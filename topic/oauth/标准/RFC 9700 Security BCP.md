## RFC 9700

## Abstract

This document describes best current security practice for OAuth 2.0. It updates and extends the threat model and security advice given in RFCs 6749, [[6750]], and [[6819]] to incorporate practical experiences gathered since OAuth 2.0 was published and covers new threats relevant due to the broader application of OAuth 2.0. Further, it deprecates some modes of operation that are deemed less secure or even insecure.[¶](#section-abstract-1)

## Status of This Memo

This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.[¶](#section-boilerplate.1-1)

This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It represents the consensus of the IETF community. It has received public review and has been approved for publication by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). Further information on BCPs is available in Section 2 of RFC 7841.[¶](#section-boilerplate.1-2)

Information about the current status of this document, any errata, and how to provide feedback on it may be obtained at [https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9700](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9700).[¶](#section-boilerplate.1-3)

## 1.

Since its publication in \[\] and \[\], OAuth 2.0 (referred to as simply "OAuth" in this document) has gained massive traction in the market and became the standard for API protection and the basis for federated login using [[OpenID Connect]] \[\]. While OAuth is used in a variety of scenarios and different kinds of deployments, the following challenges can be observed:[¶](#section-1-1)

This document provides updated security recommendations to address these challenges. It introduces new requirements beyond those defined in existing specifications such as OAuth 2.0 \[\] and [[OpenID Connect]] \[\] and deprecates some modes of operation that are deemed less secure or even insecure. However, this document does not supplant the security advice given in \[\], \[\], and \[\], but complements those documents.[¶](#section-1-3)

Naturally, not all existing ecosystems and implementations are compatible with the new requirements, and following the best practices described in this document may break interoperability. Nonetheless, it is RECOMMENDED that implementers upgrade their implementations and ecosystems as soon as feasible.[¶](#section-1-4)

OAuth 2.1, under development as \[\], will incorporate security recommendations from this document.[¶](#section-1-5)

### 1.1.

The remainder of this document is organized as follows: [^1] summarizes the most important best practices for every OAuth implementer. presents the updated OAuth attacker model. is a detailed analysis of the threats and implementation issues that can be found in the wild (at the time of writing) along with a discussion of potential countermeasures.[¶](#section-1.1-1)

### 1.2.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 \[\] \[\] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.[¶](#section-1.2-1)

This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization endpoint", "authorization grant", "authorization server", "client", "client identifier" (client ID), "protected resource", "refresh token", "resource owner", "resource server", and "token endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 \[\].[¶](#section-1.2-2)

An "open redirector" is an endpoint on a web server that forwards a user's browser to an arbitrary URI obtained from a query parameter.[¶](#section-1.2-3)

## 3.

In \[\], a threat model is laid out that describes the threats against which OAuth deployments must be protected. While doing so, \[\] makes certain assumptions about attackers and their capabilities, i.e., it implicitly establishes an attacker model. In the following, this attacker model is made explicit and is updated and expanded to account for the potentially dynamic relationships involving multiple parties (as described in ), to include new types of attackers, and to define the attacker model more clearly.[¶](#section-3-1)

The goal of this document is to ensure that the authorization of a resource owner (with a user agent) at an authorization server and the subsequent usage of the access token at a resource server is protected, as well as practically possible, at least against the following attackers.[¶](#section-3-2)

(A1)

Web attackers that can set up and operate an arbitrary number of network endpoints (besides the "honest" ones) including browsers and servers. Web attackers may set up websites that are visited by the resource owner, operate their own user agents, and participate in the protocol.[¶](#section-3-3.1.1)

In particular, web attackers may operate OAuth clients that are registered at the authorization server, and they may operate their own authorization and resource servers that can be used (in parallel to the "honest" ones) by the resource owner and other resource owners.[¶](#section-3-3.1.2)

It must also be assumed that web attackers can lure the user to navigate their browser to arbitrary attacker-chosen URIs at any time. In practice, this can be achieved in many ways, for example, by injecting malicious advertisements into advertisement networks or by sending legitimate-looking emails.[¶](#section-3-3.1.3)

Web attackers can use their own user credentials to create new messages as well as any secrets they learned previously. For example, if a web attacker learns an authorization code of a user through a misconfigured redirection URI, the web attacker can then try to redeem that code for an access token.[¶](#section-3-3.1.4)

They cannot, however, read or manipulate messages that are not targeted towards them (e.g., sent to a URL of an authorization server not under control of an attacker).[¶](#section-3-3.1.5)

(A2)

Network attackers that additionally have full control over the network over which protocol participants communicate. They can eavesdrop on, manipulate, and spoof messages, except when these are properly protected by cryptographic methods (e.g., TLS). Network attackers can also block arbitrary messages.[¶](#section-3-3.2.1)

While an example for a web attacker would be a customer of an internet service provider, network attackers could be the internet service provider itself, an attacker in a public (Wi-Fi) network using ARP spoofing, or a state-sponsored attacker with access to internet exchange points, for instance.[¶](#section-3-4)

The aforementioned attackers and conform to the attacker model that was used in formal analysis efforts for OAuth \[\]. This is a minimal attacker model. Implementers MUST take into account all possible types of attackers in the environment of their OAuth implementations. For example, in \[\], a very strong attacker model is used that includes attackers that have full control over the token endpoint. This models effects of a possible misconfiguration of endpoints in the ecosystem, which can be avoided by using authorization server metadata as described in. Such an attacker is therefore not listed here.[¶](#section-3-5)

However, previous attacks on OAuth have shown that the following types of attackers are relevant in particular:[¶](#section-3-6)

(A3)

Attackers that can read, but not modify, the contents of the authorization response (i.e., the authorization response can leak to an attacker).[¶](#section-3-7.1.1)

Examples of such attacks include open redirector attacks and mix-up attacks (see ), where the client is tricked into sending credentials to an attacker-controlled authorization server.[¶](#section-3-7.1.2)

Also, this includes attacks that take advantage of:[¶](#section-3-7.1.3)

- insufficient checking of redirect URIs (see );[¶](#section-3-7.1.4.1)
- problems existing on mobile operating systems, where different apps can register themselves on the same URI; and [¶](#section-3-7.1.4.2)
- URLs stored/logged by browsers (history), proxy servers, and operating systems.[¶](#section-3-7.1.4.3)

(A4)

Attackers that can read, but not modify, the contents of the authorization request (i.e., the authorization request can leak, in the same manner as above, to an attacker).[¶](#section-3-7.2.1)

(A5)

Attackers that can acquire an access token issued by an authorization server. For example, a resource server may be compromised by an attacker, an access token may be sent to an attacker-controlled resource server due to a misconfiguration, or social engineering may be used to get a resource owner to use an attacker-controlled resource server. Also see.[¶](#section-3-7.3.1)

,, and typically occur together with either or. Attackers can collaborate to reach a common goal.[¶](#section-3-8)

Note that an Attacker or can be a resource owner or act as one. For example, such an attacker can use their own browser to replay tokens or authorization codes obtained by any of the attacks described above at the client or resource server.[¶](#section-3-9)

This document focuses on threats resulting from Attackers to.[¶](#section-3-10)

## 4.

This section gives a detailed description of attacks on OAuth implementations, along with potential countermeasures. Attacks and mitigations already covered in \[\] are not listed here, except where new recommendations are made.[¶](#section-4-1)

This section further defines additional requirements (beyond those defined in [^1]) for certain cases and protocol options.[¶](#section-4-2)

### 4.1.

Some authorization servers allow clients to register redirection URI patterns instead of complete redirection URIs. The authorization servers then match the redirection URI parameter value at the authorization endpoint against the registered patterns at runtime. This approach allows clients to encode transaction state into additional redirect URI parameters or to register a single pattern for multiple redirection URIs.[¶](#section-4.1-1)

This approach turned out to be more complex to implement and more error-prone to manage than exact redirection URI matching. Several successful attacks exploiting flaws in the pattern-matching implementation or concrete configurations have been observed in the wild (see, e.g., \[\]). Insufficient validation of the redirection URI effectively breaks client identification or authentication (depending on grant and client type) and allows the attacker to obtain an authorization code or access token, either [¶](#section-4.1-2)

- by directly sending the user agent to a URI under the attacker's control, or [¶](#section-4.1-3.1)
- by exposing the OAuth credentials to an attacker by utilizing an open redirector at the client in conjunction with the way user agents handle URL fragments.[¶](#section-4.1-3.2)

These attacks are shown in detail in the following subsections.[¶](#section-4.1-4)

#### 4.1.1.

For a client using the grant type `code`, an attack may work as follows:[¶](#section-4.1.1-1)

Assume the redirection URL pattern `https://*.somesite.example/*` is registered for the client with the client ID `s6BhdRkqt3`. The intention is to allow any subdomain of `somesite.example` to be a valid redirection URI for the client, for example, `https://app1.somesite.example/redirect`. However, a naive implementation on the authorization server might interpret the wildcard `*` as "any character" and not "any character valid for a domain name". The authorization server, therefore, might permit `https://attacker.example/.somesite.example` as a redirection URI, although `attacker.example` is a different domain potentially controlled by a malicious party.[¶](#section-4.1.1-2)

The attack can then be conducted as follows:[¶](#section-4.1.1-3)

To begin, the attacker needs to trick the user into opening a tampered URL in their browser that launches a page under the attacker's control, say, `https://www.evil.example` (see attacker in ).[¶](#section-4.1.1-4)

This URL initiates the following authorization request with the client ID of a legitimate client to the authorization endpoint (line breaks for display only):[¶](#section-4.1.1-5)

```
GET /authorize?response_type=code&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=9ad67f13
     &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fattacker.example%2F.somesite.example
     HTTP/1.1
Host: server.somesite.example
```
[¶](#section-4.1.1-6)

The authorization server validates the redirection URI and compares it to the registered redirection URL patterns for the client `s6BhdRkqt3`. The authorization request is processed and presented to the user.[¶](#section-4.1.1-7)

If the user does not see the redirection URI or does not recognize the attack, the code is issued and immediately sent to the attacker's domain. If an automatic approval of the authorization is enabled (which is not recommended for public clients according to \[\]), the attack can be performed even without user interaction.[¶](#section-4.1.1-8)

If the attacker impersonates a public client, the attacker can exchange the code for tokens at the respective token endpoint.[¶](#section-4.1.1-9)

This attack will not work as easily for confidential clients, since the code exchange requires authentication with the legitimate client's secret. However, the attacker can use the legitimate confidential client to redeem the code by performing an authorization code injection attack; see.[¶](#section-4.1.1-10)

It is important to note that redirection URI validation vulnerabilities can also exist if the authorization server handles wildcards properly. For example, assume that the client registers the redirection URL pattern `https://*.somesite.example/*` and the authorization server interprets this as "allow redirection URIs pointing to any host residing in the domain `somesite.example` ". If an attacker manages to establish a host or subdomain in `somesite.example`, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate client. For example, this could be caused by a subdomain takeover attack \[\], where an outdated CNAME record (say, `external-service.somesite.example`) points to an external DNS name that no longer exists (say, `customer-abc.service.example`) and can be taken over by an attacker (e.g., by registering as `customer-abc` with the external service).[¶](#section-4.1.1-11)

#### 4.1.2.

The attack described above works for the implicit grant as well. If the attacker is able to send the authorization response to an attacker-controlled URI, the attacker will directly get access to the fragment carrying the access token.[¶](#section-4.1.2-1)

Additionally, implicit grants (and also other grants when using `response_mode=fragment` as defined in \[\]) can be subject to a further kind of attack. The attack utilizes the fact that user agents reattach fragments to the destination URL of a redirect if the location header does not contain a fragment (see [Section 17.11](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-17.11) of \[\]). The attack described here combines this behavior with the client as an open redirector (see ) in order to obtain access tokens. This allows circumvention even of very narrow redirection URI patterns, but not of strict URL matching.[¶](#section-4.1.2-2)

Assume the registered URL pattern for client `s6BhdRkqt3` is `https://client.somesite.example/cb?*`, i.e., any parameter is allowed for redirects to `https://client.somesite.example/cb`. Unfortunately, the client exposes an open redirector. This endpoint supports a parameter `redirect_to` which takes a target URL and will send the browser to this URL using an HTTP Location header redirect 303.[¶](#section-4.1.2-3)

The attack can now be conducted as follows:[¶](#section-4.1.2-4)

To begin, as above, the attacker needs to trick the user into opening a tampered URL in their browser that launches a page under the attacker's control, say, `https://www.evil.example`.[¶](#section-4.1.2-5)

Afterwards, the website initiates an authorization request that is very similar to the one in the attack on the code flow. Different to above, it utilizes the open redirector by encoding `redirect_to=https://attacker.example` into the parameters of the redirection URI, and it uses the response type `token` (line breaks for display only):[¶](#section-4.1.2-6)

```
GET /authorize?response_type=token&state=9ad67f13
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.somesite.example
     %2Fcb%26redirect_to%253Dhttps%253A%252F
     %252Fattacker.example%252F HTTP/1.1
Host: server.somesite.example
```
[¶](#section-4.1.2-7)

Then, since the redirection URI matches the registered pattern, the authorization server permits the request and sends the resulting access token in a 303 redirect (some response parameters omitted for readability):[¶](#section-4.1.2-8)

```
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Location: https://client.somesite.example/cb?
          redirect_to%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fattacker.example%2Fcb
          #access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA&...
```
[¶](#section-4.1.2-9)

At client.somesite.example, the request arrives at the open redirector. The endpoint will read the redirect parameter and will issue an HTTP 303 Location header redirect to the URL `https://attacker.example/`.[¶](#section-4.1.2-10)

```
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Location: https://attacker.example/
```
[¶](#section-4.1.2-11)

Since the redirector at client.somesite.example does not include a fragment in the Location header, the user agent will reattach the original fragment `#access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA&amp;...` to the URL and will navigate to the following URL:[¶](#section-4.1.2-12)

```
https://attacker.example/#access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1z...
```
[¶](#section-4.1.2-13)

The attacker's page at `attacker.example` can then access the fragment and obtain the access token.[¶](#section-4.1.2-14)

#### 4.1.3.

The complexity of implementing and managing pattern matching correctly obviously causes security issues. This document therefore advises simplifying the required logic and configuration by using exact redirection URI matching. This means the authorization server MUST ensure that the two URIs are equal; see [Section 6.2.1](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-6.2.1) of \[\], Simple String Comparison, for details. The only exception is native apps using a `localhost` URI: In this case, the authorization server MUST allow variable port numbers as described in [Section 7.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252#section-7.3) of \[\].[¶](#section-4.1.3-1)

Additional recommendations:[¶](#section-4.1.3-2)

- Web servers on which redirection URIs are hosted MUST NOT expose open redirectors (see ).[¶](#section-4.1.3-3.1)
- Browsers reattach URL fragments to Location redirection URLs only if the URL in the Location header does not already contain a fragment. Therefore, servers MAY prevent browsers from reattaching fragments to redirection URLs by attaching an arbitrary fragment identifier, for example `#_`, to URLs in Location headers.[¶](#section-4.1.3-3.2)
- Clients SHOULD use the authorization code response type instead of response types that cause access token issuance at the authorization endpoint. This offers countermeasures against the reuse of leaked credentials through the exchange process with the authorization server and against token replay through sender-constraining of the access tokens.[¶](#section-4.1.3-3.3)

If the origin and integrity of the authorization request containing the redirection URI can be verified, for example, when using \[\] or \[\] with client authentication, the authorization server MAY trust the redirection URI without further checks.[¶](#section-4.1.3-4)

### 4.2.

The contents of the authorization request URI or the authorization response URI can unintentionally be disclosed to attackers through the Referer HTTP header (see [Section 10.1.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-10.1.3) of \[\]), by leaking from either the authorization server's or the client's website, respectively. Most importantly, authorization codes or `state` values can be disclosed in this way. Although specified otherwise in [Section 10.1.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-10.1.3) of \[\], the same may happen to access tokens conveyed in URI fragments due to browser implementation issues, as illustrated by a (now fixed) issue in the Chromium project \[\].[¶](#section-4.2-1)

#### 4.2.1.

Leakage from the OAuth client requires that the client, as a result of a successful authorization request, renders a page that [¶](#section-4.2.1-1)

- contains links to other pages under the attacker's control and a user clicks on such a link, or [¶](#section-4.2.1-2.1)
- includes third-party content (advertisements in iframes, images, etc.), for example, if the page contains user-generated content (blog).[¶](#section-4.2.1-2.2)

As soon as the browser navigates to the attacker's page or loads the third-party content, the attacker receives the authorization response URL and can extract `code` or `state` (and potentially `access_token`).[¶](#section-4.2.1-3)

#### 4.2.2.

In a similar way, an attacker can learn `state` from the authorization request if the authorization endpoint at the authorization server contains links or third-party content as above.[¶](#section-4.2.2-1)

#### 4.2.3.

An attacker that learns a valid code or access token through a Referer header can perform the attacks as described in Sections, and. If the attacker learns `state`, the CSRF protection achieved by using `state` is lost, resulting in CSRF attacks as described in [Section 4.4.1.8](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.8) of \[\].[¶](#section-4.2.3-1)

#### 4.2.4.

The page rendered as a result of the OAuth authorization response and the authorization endpoint SHOULD NOT include third-party resources or links to external sites.[¶](#section-4.2.4-1)

The following measures further reduce the chances of a successful attack:[¶](#section-4.2.4-2)

- Suppress the Referer header by applying an appropriate Referrer Policy \[\] to the document (either as part of the "referrer" meta attribute or by setting a Referrer-Policy header). For example, the header `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` in the response completely suppresses the Referer header in all requests originating from the resulting document.[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.1)
- Use authorization code instead of response types causing access token issuance from the authorization endpoint.[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.2)
- Bind the authorization code to a confidential client or PKCE challenge. In this case, the attacker lacks the secret to request the code exchange.[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.3)
- As described in [Section 4.1.2](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.1.2) of \[\], authorization codes MUST be invalidated by the authorization server after their first use at the token endpoint. For example, if an authorization server invalidated the code after the legitimate client redeemed it, the attacker would fail to exchange this code later.[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.4.1)
	This does not mitigate the attack if the attacker manages to exchange the code for a token before the legitimate client does so. Therefore, \[\] further recommends that, when an attempt is made to redeem a code twice, the authorization server SHOULD revoke all tokens issued previously based on that code.[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.4.2)
- The `state` value SHOULD be invalidated by the client after its first use at the redirection endpoint. If this is implemented, and an attacker receives a token through the Referer header from the client's website, the `state` was already used, invalidated by the client and cannot be used again by the attacker. (This does not help if the `state` leaks from the authorization server's website, since then the `state` has not been used at the redirection endpoint at the client yet.) [¶](#section-4.2.4-3.5.1)
- Use the form post response mode instead of a redirect for the authorization response (see \[\]).[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.6.1)

### 4.3.

Authorization codes and access tokens can end up in the browser's history of visited URLs, enabling the attacks described in the following.[¶](#section-4.3-1)

#### 4.3.1.

When a browser navigates to `client.example/redirection_endpoint?code=abcd` as a result of a redirect from a provider's authorization endpoint, the URL including the authorization code may end up in the browser's history. An attacker with access to the device could obtain the code and try to replay it.[¶](#section-4.3.1-1)

Countermeasures:[¶](#section-4.3.1-2)

- Authorization code replay prevention as described in [Section 4.4.1.1](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.1) of \[\], and.[¶](#section-4.3.1-3.1)
- Use the form post response mode instead of redirect for the authorization response (see \[\]).[¶](#section-4.3.1-3.2)

#### 4.3.2.

An access token may end up in the browser history if a client or a website that already has a token deliberately navigates to a page like `provider.com/get_user_profile?access_token=abcdef`. \[\] discourages this practice and advises transferring tokens via a header, but in practice websites often pass access tokens in query parameters.[¶](#section-4.3.2-1)

In the case of implicit grant, a URL like `client.example/redirection_endpoint#access_token=abcdef` may also end up in the browser history as a result of a redirect from a provider's authorization endpoint.[¶](#section-4.3.2-2)

Countermeasures:[¶](#section-4.3.2-3)

- Clients MUST NOT pass access tokens in a URI query parameter in the way described in [Section 2.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750#section-2.3) of \[\]. The authorization code grant or alternative OAuth response modes like the form post response mode \[\] can be used to this end.[¶](#section-4.3.2-4.1)

### 4.4.

Mix-up attacks can occur in scenarios where an OAuth client interacts with two or more authorization servers and at least one authorization server is under the control of the attacker. This can be the case, for example, if the attacker uses dynamic registration to register the client at their own authorization server or if an authorization server becomes compromised.[¶](#section-4.4-1)

The goal of the attack is to obtain an authorization code or an access token for an uncompromised authorization server. This is achieved by tricking the client into sending those credentials to the compromised authorization server (the attacker) instead of using them at the respective endpoint of the uncompromised authorization/resource server.[¶](#section-4.4-2)

#### 4.4.1.

The description here follows \[\], with variants of the attack outlined below.[¶](#section-4.4.1-1)

Preconditions: For this variant of the attack to work, it is assumed that [¶](#section-4.4.1-2)

- the implicit or authorization code grant is used with multiple authorization servers of which one is considered "honest" (H-AS) and one is operated by the attacker (A-AS), and [¶](#section-4.4.1-3.1)
- the client stores the authorization server chosen by the user in a session bound to the user's browser and uses the same redirection URI for each authorization server.[¶](#section-4.4.1-3.2)

In the following, it is further assumed that the client is registered with H-AS (URI: `https://honest.as.example`, client ID: `7ZGZldHQ`) and with A-AS (URI: `https://attacker.example`, client ID: `666RVZJTA`). URLs shown in the following example are shortened for presentation to include only parameters relevant to the attack.[¶](#section-4.4.1-4)

Attack on the authorization code grant:[¶](#section-4.4.1-5)

1. The user selects to start the grant using A-AS (e.g., by clicking on a button on the client's website).[¶](#section-4.4.1-6.1)
2. The client stores in the user's session that the user selected "A-AS" and redirects the user to A-AS's authorization endpoint with a Location header containing the URL `https://attacker.example/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=666RVZJTA`.[¶](#step_2_mixup)
3. When the user's browser navigates to the attacker's authorization endpoint, the attacker immediately redirects the browser to the authorization endpoint of H-AS. In the authorization request, the attacker replaces the client ID of the client at A-AS with the client's ID at H-AS. Therefore, the browser receives a redirection (303 See Other) with a Location header pointing to `https://honest.as.example/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=7ZGZldHQ` [¶](#section-4.4.1-6.3)
4. The user authorizes the client to access their resources at H-AS. (Note that a vigilant user might at this point detect that they intended to use A-AS instead of H-AS. The first attack variant listed does not have this limitation.) H-AS issues a code and sends it (via the browser) back to the client.[¶](#section-4.4.1-6.4.1)
5. Since the client still assumes that the code was issued by A-AS, it will try to redeem the code at A-AS's token endpoint.[¶](#section-4.4.1-6.5.1)
6. The attacker therefore obtains code and can either exchange the code for an access token (for public clients) or perform an authorization code injection attack as described in.[¶](#section-4.4.1-6.6.1)

Variants:[¶](#section-4.4.1-7)

- Mix-Up with Interception: This variant works only if the attacker can intercept and manipulate the first request/response pair from a user's browser to the client (in which the user selects a certain authorization server and is then redirected by the client to that authorization server), as in (see ). This capability can, for example, be the result of an attacker-in-the-middle attack on the user's connection to the client. In the attack, the user starts the flow with H-AS. The attacker intercepts this request and changes the user's selection to A-AS. The rest of the attack proceeds as in and following above.[¶](#section-4.4.1-8.1)
- Implicit Grant: In the implicit grant, the attacker receives an access token instead of the code in. The attacker's authorization server receives the access token when the client makes either a request to the A-AS userinfo endpoint (defined in \[\]) or a request to the attacker's resource server (since the client believes it has completed the flow with A-AS).[¶](#section-4.4.1-8.2)
- Per-AS Redirect URIs: If clients use different redirection URIs for different authorization servers, clients do not store the selected authorization server in the user's session, and authorization servers do not check the redirection URIs properly, attackers can mount an attack called "Cross Social-Network Request Forgery". These attacks have been observed in practice. Refer to \[\] for details.[¶](#section-4.4.1-8.3)
- [[OpenID Connect]]: Some variants can be used to attack [[OpenID Connect]]. In these attacks, the attacker misuses features of the [[OpenID Connect]] Discovery \[\] mechanism or replays access tokens or ID Tokens to conduct a mix-up attack. The attacks are described in detail in Appendix A of \[\] and Section 6 of \[\] ("Malicious Endpoints Attacks").[¶](#section-4.4.1-8.4)

#### 4.4.2.

When an OAuth client can only interact with one authorization server, a mix-up defense is not required. In scenarios where an OAuth client interacts with two or more authorization servers, however, clients MUST prevent mix-up attacks. Two different methods are discussed below.[¶](#section-4.4.2-1)

For both defenses, clients MUST store, for each authorization request, the issuer they sent the authorization request to and bind this information to the user agent. The issuer serves, via the associated metadata, as an abstract identifier for the combination of the authorization endpoint and token endpoint that are to be used in the flow. If an issuer identifier is not available (for example, if neither OAuth Authorization Server Metadata \[\] nor [[OpenID Connect]] Discovery \[\] is used), a different unique identifier for this tuple or the tuple itself can be used instead. For brevity of presentation, such a deployment-specific identifier will be subsumed under the issuer (or issuer identifier) in the following.[¶](#section-4.4.2-2)

It is important to note that just storing the authorization server URL is not sufficient to identify mix-up attacks. An attacker might declare an uncompromised authorization server's authorization endpoint URL as "their" authorization server URL, but declare a token endpoint under their own control.[¶](#section-4.4.2-3)

##### 4.4.2.1.

This defense requires that the authorization server sends its issuer identifier in the authorization response to the client. When receiving the authorization response, the client MUST compare the received issuer identifier to the stored issuer identifier. If there is a mismatch, the client MUST abort the interaction.[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-1)

There are different ways this issuer identifier can be transported to the client:[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-2)

- The issuer information can be transported, for example, via a separate response parameter `iss`, defined in \[\].[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-3.1)
- When [[OpenID Connect]] is used and an ID Token is returned in the authorization response, the client can evaluate the `iss` claim in the ID Token.[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-3.2)

In both cases, the `iss` value MUST be evaluated according to \[\].[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-4)

While this defense may require deploying new OAuth features to transport the issuer information, it is a robust and relatively simple defense against mix-up.[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-5)

##### 4.4.2.2.

For this defense, clients MUST use a distinct redirection URI for each issuer they interact with.[¶](#section-4.4.2.2-1)

Clients MUST check that the authorization response was received from the correct issuer by comparing the distinct redirection URI for the issuer to the URI where the authorization response was received on. If there is a mismatch, the client MUST abort the flow.[¶](#section-4.4.2.2-2)

While this defense builds upon existing OAuth functionality, it cannot be used in scenarios where clients only register once for the use of many different issuers (as in some open banking schemes) and due to the tight integration with the client registration, it is harder to deploy automatically.[¶](#section-4.4.2.2-3)

Furthermore, an attacker might be able to circumvent the protection offered by this defense by registering a new client with the "honest" authorization server using the redirect URI that the client assigned to the attacker's authorization server. The attacker could then run the attack as described above, replacing the client ID with the client ID of their newly created client.[¶](#section-4.4.2.2-4)

This defense SHOULD therefore only be used if other options are not available.[¶](#section-4.4.2.2-5)

### 4.5.

An attacker who has gained access to an authorization code contained in an authorization response (see in ) can try to redeem the authorization code for an access token or otherwise make use of the authorization code.[¶](#section-4.5-1)

In the case that the authorization code was created for a public client, the attacker can send the authorization code to the token endpoint of the authorization server and thereby get an access token. This attack was described in [Section 4.4.1.1](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.1) of \[\].[¶](#section-4.5-2)

For confidential clients, or in some special situations, the attacker can execute an authorization code injection attack, as described in the following.[¶](#section-4.5-3)

In an authorization code injection attack, the attacker attempts to inject a stolen authorization code into the attacker's own session with the client. The aim is to associate the attacker's session at the client with the victim's resources or identity, thereby giving the attacker at least limited access to the victim's resources.[¶](#section-4.5-4)

Besides circumventing the client authentication of confidential clients, other use cases for this attack include:[¶](#section-4.5-5)

- The attacker wants to access certain functions in this particular client. As an example, the attacker wants to impersonate their victim in a certain app or on a certain website.[¶](#section-4.5-6.1)
- The authorization or resource servers are limited to certain networks that the attacker is unable to access directly.[¶](#section-4.5-6.2)

Except in these special cases, authorization code injection is usually not interesting when the code is created for a public client, as sending the code to the token endpoint is a simpler and more powerful attack, as described above.[¶](#section-4.5-7)

#### 4.5.1.

The authorization code injection attack works as follows:[¶](#section-4.5.1-1)

1. The attacker obtains an authorization code (see in ). For the rest of the attack, only the capabilities of a web attacker are required.[¶](#section-4.5.1-2.1)
2. From the attacker's device, the attacker starts a regular OAuth authorization process with the legitimate client.[¶](#step_2_code_injection)
3. In the response of the authorization server to the legitimate client, the attacker replaces the newly created authorization code with the stolen authorization code. Since this response is passing through the attacker's device, the attacker can use any tool that can intercept and manipulate the authorization response to this end. The attacker does not need to control the network.[¶](#step_3_code_injection)
4. The legitimate client sends the code to the authorization server's token endpoint, along with the `redirect_uri` and the client's client ID and client secret (or other means of client authentication).[¶](#section-4.5.1-2.4)
5. The authorization server checks the client secret, whether the code was issued to the particular client, and whether the actual redirection URI matches the `redirect_uri` parameter (see \[\]).[¶](#checkin)
6. All checks succeed and the authorization server issues access and other tokens to the client. The attacker has now associated their session with the legitimate client with the victim's resources and/or identity.[¶](#section-4.5.1-2.6)

#### 4.5.3.

There are two good technical solutions to binding authorization codes to client instances, as follows.[¶](#section-4.5.3-1)

##### 4.5.3.1.

The PKCE mechanism specified in \[\] can be used as a countermeasure (even though it was originally designed to secure native apps). When the attacker attempts to inject an authorization code, the check of the `code_verifier` fails: the client uses its correct verifier, but the code is associated with a `code_challenge` that does not match this verifier.[¶](#section-4.5.3.1-1)

PKCE not only protects against the authorization code injection attack but also protects authorization codes created for public clients: PKCE ensures that an attacker cannot redeem a stolen authorization code at the token endpoint of the authorization server without knowledge of the `code_verifier`.[¶](#section-4.5.3.1-2)

##### 4.5.3.2.

[[OpenID Connect]]'s existing `nonce` parameter can protect against authorization code injection attacks. The `nonce` value is one-time use and is created by the client. The client is supposed to bind it to the user agent session and send it with the initial request to the OpenID Provider (OP). The OP puts the received `nonce` value into the ID Token that is issued as part of the code exchange at the token endpoint. If an attacker injects an authorization code in the authorization response, the nonce value in the client session and the `nonce` value in the ID Token received from the token endpoint will not match, and the attack is detected. The assumption is that an attacker cannot get hold of the user agent state on the victim's device (from which the attacker has stolen the respective authorization code).[¶](#section-4.5.3.2-1)

It is important to note that this countermeasure only works if the client properly checks the `nonce` parameter in the ID Token obtained from the token endpoint and does not use any issued token until this check has succeeded. More precisely, a client protecting itself against code injection using the `nonce` parameter [¶](#section-4.5.3.2-2)

1. MUST validate the `nonce` in the ID Token obtained from the token endpoint, even if another ID Token was obtained from the authorization response (e.g., `response_type=code+id_token`), and [¶](#section-4.5.3.2-3.1)
2. MUST ensure that, unless and until that check succeeds, all tokens (ID Tokens and the access token) are disregarded and not used for any other purpose.[¶](#section-4.5.3.2-3.2)

It is important to note that `nonce` does not protect authorization codes of public clients, as an attacker does not need to execute an authorization code injection attack. Instead, an attacker can directly call the token endpoint with the stolen authorization code.[¶](#section-4.5.3.2-4)

##### 4.5.3.3.

Other solutions like binding `state` to the code, sender-constraining the code using cryptographic means, or per-instance client credentials are conceivable, but lack support and bring new security requirements.[¶](#section-4.5.3.3-1)

PKCE is the most obvious solution for OAuth clients, as it is available at the time of writing, while `nonce` is appropriate for [[OpenID Connect]] clients.[¶](#section-4.5.3.3-2)

#### 4.5.4.

An attacker can circumvent the countermeasures described above if they can modify the `nonce` or `code_challenge` values that are used in the victim's authorization request. The attacker can modify these values to be the same ones as those chosen by the client in their own session in of the attack above. (This requires that the victim's session with the client begins after the attacker started their session with the client.) If the attacker is then able to capture the authorization code from the victim, the attacker will be able to inject the stolen code in even if PKCE or `nonce` are used.[¶](#section-4.5.4-1)

This attack is complex and requires a close interaction between the attacker and the victim's session. Nonetheless, measures to prevent attackers from reading the contents of the authorization response still need to be taken, as described in Sections,,,, and.[¶](#section-4.5.4-2)

### 4.6.

In an access token injection attack, the attacker attempts to inject a stolen access token into a legitimate client (that is not under the attacker's control). This will typically happen if the attacker wants to utilize a leaked access token to impersonate a user in a certain client.[¶](#section-4.6-1)

To conduct the attack, the attacker starts an OAuth flow with the client using the implicit grant and modifies the authorization response by replacing the access token issued by the authorization server or directly making up an authorization server response including the leaked access token. Since the response includes the `state` value generated by the client for this particular transaction, the client does not treat the response as a CSRF attack and uses the access token injected by the attacker.[¶](#section-4.6-2)

#### 4.6.1.

There is no way to detect such an injection attack in pure-OAuth flows since the token is issued without any binding to the transaction or the particular user agent.[¶](#section-4.6.1-1)

In [[OpenID Connect]], the attack can be mitigated, as the authorization response additionally contains an ID Token containing the `at_hash` claim. The attacker therefore needs to replace both the access token as well as the ID Token in the response. The attacker cannot forge the ID Token, as it is signed or encrypted with authentication. The attacker also cannot inject a leaked ID Token matching the stolen access token, as the `nonce` claim in the leaked ID Token will contain (with a very high probability) a different value than the one expected in the authorization response.[¶](#section-4.6.1-2)

Note that further protection, like sender-constrained access tokens, is still required to prevent attackers from using the access token at the resource endpoint directly.[¶](#section-4.6.1-3)

The recommendations in follow from this.[¶](#section-4.6.1-4)

### 4.7.

An attacker might attempt to inject a request to the redirection URI of the legitimate client on the victim's device, e.g., to cause the client to access resources under the attacker's control. This is a variant of an attack known as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).[¶](#section-4.7-1)

#### 4.7.1.

The long-established countermeasure is that clients pass a random value, also known as a CSRF Token, in the `state` parameter that links the request to the redirection URI to the user agent session as described. This countermeasure is described in detail in [Section 5.3.5](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6819#section-5.3.5) of \[\]. The same protection is provided by PKCE or the [[OpenID Connect]] `nonce` value.[¶](#section-4.7.1-1)

When using PKCE instead of `state` or `nonce` for CSRF protection, it is important to note that:[¶](#section-4.7.1-2)

- Clients MUST ensure that the authorization server supports PKCE before using PKCE for CSRF protection. If an authorization server does not support PKCE, `state` or `nonce` MUST be used for CSRF protection.[¶](#section-4.7.1-3.1.1)
- If `state` is used for carrying application state, and the integrity of its contents is a concern, clients MUST protect `state` against tampering and swapping. This can be achieved by binding the contents of state to the browser session and/or by signing/encrypting state values. One example of this is discussed in the expired Internet-Draft \[\].[¶](#section-4.7.1-3.2.1)

The authorization server therefore MUST provide a way to detect their support for PKCE. Using Authorization Server Metadata according to \[\] is RECOMMENDED, but authorization servers MAY instead provide a deployment-specific way to ensure or determine PKCE support.[¶](#section-4.7.1-4)

PKCE provides robust protection against CSRF attacks even in the presence of an attacker that can read the authorization response (see in ). When `state` is used or an ID Token is returned in the authorization response (e.g., `response_type=code+id_token`), the attacker either learns the `state` value and can replay it into the forged authorization response, or can extract the `nonce` from the ID Token and use it in a new request to the authorization server to mint an ID Token with the same `nonce`. The new ID Token can then be used for the CSRF attack.[¶](#section-4.7.1-5)

### 4.8.

An authorization server that supports PKCE but does not make its use mandatory for all flows can be susceptible to a PKCE downgrade attack.[¶](#section-4.8-1)

The first prerequisite for this attack is that there is an attacker-controllable flag in the authorization request that enables or disables PKCE for the particular flow. The presence or absence of the `code_challenge` parameter lends itself for this purpose, i.e., the authorization server enables and enforces PKCE if this parameter is present in the authorization request, but it does not enforce PKCE if the parameter is missing.[¶](#section-4.8-2)

The second prerequisite for this attack is that the client is not using `state` at all (e.g., because the client relies on PKCE for CSRF prevention) or that the client is not checking `state` correctly.[¶](#section-4.8-3)

Roughly speaking, this attack is a variant of a CSRF attack. The attacker achieves the same goal as in the attack described in: The attacker injects an authorization code (and with that, an access token) that is bound to the attacker's resources into a session between their victim and the client.[¶](#section-4.8-4)

#### 4.8.1.

1. The user has started an OAuth session using some client at an authorization server. In the authorization request, the client has set the parameter `code_challenge=hash(abc)` as the PKCE code challenge (with the hash function and parameter encoding as defined in \[\]). The client is now waiting to receive the authorization response from the user's browser.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.1)
2. To conduct the attack, the attacker uses their own device to start an authorization flow with the targeted client. The client now uses another PKCE code challenge, say, `code_challenge=hash(xyz)`, in the authorization request. The attacker intercepts the request and removes the entire `code_challenge` parameter from the request. Since this step is performed on the attacker's device, the attacker has full access to the request contents, for example, using browser debug tools.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.2)
3. If the authorization server allows for flows without PKCE, it will create a code that is not bound to any PKCE code challenge.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.3)
4. The attacker now redirects the user's browser to an authorization response URL that contains the code for the attacker's session with the authorization server.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.4)
5. The user's browser sends the authorization code to the client, which will now try to redeem the code for an access token at the authorization server. The client will send `code_verifier=abc` as the PKCE code verifier in the token request.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.5)
6. Since the authorization server sees that this code is not bound to any PKCE code challenge, it will not check the presence or contents of the `code_verifier` parameter. It will issue an access token (which belongs to the attacker's resource) to the client under the user's control.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.6)

#### 4.8.2.

Using `state` properly would prevent this attack. However, practice has shown that many OAuth clients do not use or check `state` properly.[¶](#section-4.8.2-1)

Therefore, authorization servers MUST mitigate this attack.[¶](#section-4.8.2-2)

Note that from the view of the authorization server, in the attack described above, a `code_verifier` parameter is received at the token endpoint although no `code_challenge` parameter was present in the authorization request for the OAuth flow in which the authorization code was issued.[¶](#section-4.8.2-3)

This fact can be used to mitigate this attack. \[\] already mandates that [¶](#section-4.8.2-4)

- an authorization server that supports PKCE MUST check whether a code challenge is contained in the authorization request and bind this information to the code that is issued; and [¶](#section-4.8.2-5.1)
- when a code arrives at the token endpoint, and there was a `code_challenge` in the authorization request for which this code was issued, there must be a valid `code_verifier` in the token request.[¶](#section-4.8.2-5.2)

Beyond this, to prevent PKCE downgrade attacks, the authorization server MUST ensure that if there was no `code_challenge` in the authorization request, a request to the token endpoint containing a `code_verifier` is rejected.[¶](#section-4.8.2-6)

Authorization servers that mandate the use of PKCE (in general or for particular clients) implicitly implement this security measure.[¶](#section-4.8.2-7)

### 4.9.

Access tokens can leak from a resource server under certain circumstances.[¶](#section-4.9-1)

#### 4.9.1.

An attacker may set up their own resource server and trick a client into sending access tokens to it that are valid for other resource servers (see Attackers and in ). If the client sends a valid access token to this counterfeit resource server, the attacker in turn may use that token to access other services on behalf of the resource owner.[¶](#section-4.9.1-1)

This attack assumes the client is not bound to one specific resource server (and its URL) at development time, but client instances are provided with the resource server URL at runtime. This kind of late binding is typical in situations where the client uses a service implementing a standardized API (e.g., for email, calendaring, eHealth, or open banking) and where the client is configured by a user or administrator.[¶](#section-4.9.1-2)

#### 4.9.2.

An attacker may compromise a resource server to gain access to the resources of the respective deployment. Such a compromise may range from partial access to the system, e.g., its log files, to full control over the respective server, in which case all controls can be circumvented and all resources can be accessed. The attacker would also be able to obtain other access tokens held on the compromised system that would potentially be valid to access other resource servers.[¶](#section-4.9.2-1)

Preventing server breaches by hardening and monitoring server systems is considered a standard operational procedure and, therefore, out of the scope of this document. focuses on the impact of OAuth-related breaches and the replaying of captured access tokens.[¶](#section-4.9.2-2)

#### 4.9.3.

The following measures should be taken into account by implementers in order to cope with access token replay by malicious actors:[¶](#section-4.9.3-1)

- Sender-constrained access tokens, as described in, SHOULD be used to prevent the attacker from replaying the access tokens on other resource servers. If an attacker has only partial access to the compromised system, like a read-only access to web server logs, sender-constrained access tokens may also prevent replay on the compromised system.[¶](#section-4.9.3-2.1)
- Audience restriction as described in SHOULD be used to prevent replay of captured access tokens on other resource servers.[¶](#section-4.9.3-2.2)
- The resource server MUST treat access tokens like other sensitive secrets and not store or transfer them in plaintext.[¶](#section-4.9.3-2.3)

The first and second recommendations also apply to other scenarios where access tokens leak (see in ).[¶](#section-4.9.3-3)

### 4.10.

Access tokens can be stolen by an attacker in various ways, for example, via the attacks described in Sections,,,, and. Some of these attacks can be mitigated by specific security measures, as described in the respective sections. However, in some cases, these measures are not sufficient or are not implemented correctly. Authorization servers therefore SHOULD ensure that access tokens are sender-constrained and audience-restricted as described in the following. Architecture and performance reasons may prevent the use of these measures in some deployments.[¶](#section-4.10-1)

#### 4.10.1.

As the name suggests, sender-constrained access tokens scope the applicability of an access token to a certain sender. This sender is obliged to demonstrate knowledge of a certain secret as a prerequisite for the acceptance of that token at a resource server.[¶](#section-4.10.1-1)

A typical flow looks like this:[¶](#section-4.10.1-2)

1. The authorization server associates data with the access token that binds this particular token to a certain client. The binding can utilize the client's identity, but in most cases, the authorization server utilizes key material (or data derived from the key material) known to the client.[¶](#section-4.10.1-3.1)
2. This key material must be distributed somehow. Either the key material already exists before the authorization server creates the binding or the authorization server creates ephemeral keys. The way preexisting key material is distributed varies among the different approaches. For example, X.509 certificates can be used, in which case the distribution happens explicitly during the enrollment process. Or, the key material is created and distributed at the TLS layer, in which case it might automatically happen during the setup of a TLS connection.[¶](#section-4.10.1-3.2)
3. The resource server must implement the actual proof-of-possession check. This is typically done on the application level, often tied to specific material provided by the transport layer (e.g., TLS). The resource server must also ensure that a replay of the proof of possession is not possible.[¶](#section-4.10.1-3.3)

Two methods for sender-constrained access tokens using proof of possession have been defined by the OAuth working group and are in use in practice:[¶](#section-4.10.1-4)

- [["OAuth 2.0]] Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens" \[\]: The approach specified in this) document allows the use of mutual TLS for both client authentication and sender-constrained access tokens. For the purpose of sender-constrained access tokens, the client is identified towards the resource server by the fingerprint of its public key. During the processing of an access token request, the authorization server obtains the client's public key from the TLS stack and associates its fingerprint with the respective access tokens. The resource server in the same way obtains the public key from the TLS stack and compares its fingerprint with the fingerprint associated with the access token.[¶](#section-4.10.1-5.1)
- [["OAuth 2.0]] Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP)" \[\]: DPoP outlines an application-level mechanism for sender-constraining access and refresh tokens. It uses proof-of-possession based on a public/private key pair and application-level signing. DPoP can be used with public clients and, in the case of confidential clients, can be combined with any client authentication method.[¶](#section-4.10.1-5.2)

Note that the security of sender-constrained tokens is undermined when an attacker gets access to the token and the key material. This is, in particular, the case for corrupted client software and cross-site scripting attacks (when the client is running in the browser). If the key material is protected in a hardware or software security module or only indirectly accessible (like in a TLS stack), sender-constrained tokens at least protect against the use of the token when the client is offline, i.e., when the security module or interface is not available to the attacker. This applies to access tokens as well as to refresh tokens (see ).[¶](#section-4.10.1-6)

#### 4.10.2.

Audience restriction essentially restricts access tokens to a particular resource server. The authorization server associates the access token with the particular resource server, and the resource server is then supposed to verify the intended audience. If the access token fails the intended audience validation, the resource server refuses to serve the respective request.[¶](#section-4.10.2-1)

In general, audience restriction limits the impact of token leakage. In the case of a counterfeit resource server, it may (as described below) also prevent abuse of the phished access token at the legitimate resource server.[¶](#section-4.10.2-2)

The audience can be expressed using logical names or physical addresses (like URLs). To prevent phishing, it is necessary to use the actual URL the client will send requests to. In the phishing case, this URL will point to the counterfeit resource server. If the attacker tries to use the access token at the legitimate resource server (which has a different URL), the resource server will detect the mismatch (wrong audience) and refuse to serve the request.[¶](#section-4.10.2-3)

In deployments where the authorization server knows the URLs of all resource servers, the authorization server may just refuse to issue access tokens for unknown resource server URLs.[¶](#section-4.10.2-4)

For this to work, the client needs to tell the authorization server the intended resource server. The mechanism in \[\] can be used for this or the information can be encoded in the scope value ([Section 3.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-3.3) of \[\]).[¶](#section-4.10.2-5)

Instead of the URL, it is also possible to utilize the fingerprint of the resource server's X.509 certificate as the audience value. This variant would also allow detection of an attempt to spoof the legitimate resource server's URL by using a valid TLS certificate obtained from a different CA. It might also be considered a privacy benefit to hide the resource server URL from the authorization server.[¶](#section-4.10.2-6)

Audience restriction may seem easier to use since it does not require any cryptography on the client side. Still, since every access token is bound to a specific resource server, the client also needs to obtain a single resource server-specific access token when accessing several resource servers. (Resource indicators, as specified in \[\], can help to achieve this.) \[\] had the same property since different token-binding IDs must be associated with the access token. Using mutual TLS for OAuth 2.0 \[\], on the other hand, allows a client to use the access token at multiple resource servers.[¶](#section-4.10.2-7)

It should be noted that audience restrictions -- or, generally speaking, an indication by the client to the authorization server where it wants to use the access token -- have additional benefits beyond the scope of token leakage prevention. They allow the authorization server to create a different access token whose format and content are specifically minted for the respective server. This has huge functional and privacy advantages in deployments using structured access tokens.[¶](#section-4.10.2-8)

#### 4.10.3.

An authorization server could provide the client with additional information about the locations where it is safe to use its access tokens. This approach, and why it is not recommended, is discussed in the following.[¶](#section-4.10.3-1)

In the simplest form, this would require the authorization server to publish a list of its known resource servers, illustrated in the following example using a non-standard Authorization Server Metadata parameter `resource_servers`:[¶](#section-4.10.3-2)

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "issuer":"https://server.somesite.example",
  "authorization_endpoint":
    "https://server.somesite.example/authorize",
  "resource_servers":[
    "email.somesite.example",
    "storage.somesite.example",
    "video.somesite.example"
  ]
  ...
}
```
[¶](#section-4.10.3-3)

The authorization server could also return the URL(s) an access token is good for in the token response, illustrated by the example and non-standard return parameter `access_token_resource_server`:[¶](#section-4.10.3-4)

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
  "access_token_resource_server":
    "https://hostedresource.somesite.example/path1",
...
}
```
[¶](#section-4.10.3-5)

This mitigation strategy would rely on the client to enforce the security policy and to only send access tokens to legitimate destinations. Results of OAuth-related security research (see, for example, \[\] and \[\]) indicate a large portion of client implementations do not or fail to properly implement security controls, like `state` checks. So, relying on clients to prevent access token phishing is likely to fail as well. Moreover, given the ratio of clients to authorization and resource servers, it is considered the more viable approach to move as much as possible security-related logic to those servers. Clearly, the client has to contribute to the overall security. However, there are alternative countermeasures, as described in Sections and, that provide a better balance between the involved parties.[¶](#section-4.10.3-6)

### 4.11.

The following attacks can occur when an authorization server or client has an open redirector. Such endpoints are sometimes implemented, for example, to show a message before a user is then redirected to an external website, or to redirect users back to a URL they were intending to visit before being interrupted, e.g., by a login prompt.[¶](#section-4.11-1)

#### 4.11.1.

Clients MUST NOT expose open redirectors. Attackers may use open redirectors to produce URLs pointing to the client and utilize them to exfiltrate authorization codes and access tokens, as described in. Another abuse case is to produce URLs that appear to point to the client. This might trick users into trusting the URL and following it in their browser. This can be abused for phishing.[¶](#section-4.11.1-1)

In order to prevent open redirection, clients should only redirect if the target URLs are allowed or if the origin and integrity of a request can be authenticated. Countermeasures against open redirection are described by OWASP \[\].[¶](#section-4.11.1-2)

#### 4.11.2.

Just as with clients, attackers could try to utilize a user's trust in the authorization server (and its URL in particular) for performing phishing attacks. OAuth authorization servers regularly redirect users to other websites (the clients), but they must do so safely.[¶](#section-4.11.2-1)

[Section 4.1.2.1](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1) of \[\] already prevents open redirects by stating that the authorization server MUST NOT automatically redirect the user agent in case of an invalid combination of `client_id` and `redirect_uri`.[¶](#section-4.11.2-2)

However, an attacker could also utilize a correctly registered redirection URI to perform phishing attacks. The attacker could, for example, register a client via dynamic client registration \[\] and execute one of the following attacks:[¶](#section-4.11.2-3)

1. Intentionally send an erroneous authorization request, e.g., by using an invalid scope value, thus instructing the authorization server to redirect the user agent to its phishing site.[¶](#section-4.11.2-4.1)
2. Intentionally send a valid authorization request with `client_id` and `redirect_uri` controlled by the attacker. After the user authenticates, the authorization server prompts the user to provide consent to the request. If the user notices an issue with the request and declines the request, the authorization server still redirects the user agent to the phishing site. In this case, the user agent will be redirected to the phishing site regardless of the action taken by the user.[¶](#section-4.11.2-4.2)
3. Intentionally send a valid silent authentication request (`prompt=none`) with `client_id` and `redirect_uri` controlled by the attacker. In this case, the authorization server will automatically redirect the user agent to the phishing site.[¶](#section-4.11.2-4.3)

The authorization server MUST take precautions to prevent these threats. The authorization server MUST always authenticate the user first and, with the exception of the silent authentication use case, prompt the user for credentials when needed, before redirecting the user. Based on its risk assessment, the authorization server needs to decide whether or not it can trust the redirection URI. It could take into account URI analytics done internally or through some external service to evaluate the credibility and trustworthiness of content behind the URI, and the source of the redirection URI and other client data.[¶](#section-4.11.2-5)

The authorization server SHOULD only automatically redirect the user agent if it trusts the redirection URI. If the URI is not trusted, the authorization server MAY inform the user and rely on the user to make the correct decision.[¶](#section-4.11.2-6)

### 4.12.

At the authorization endpoint, a typical protocol flow is that the authorization server prompts the user to enter their credentials in a form that is then submitted (using the HTTP POST method) back to the authorization server. The authorization server checks the credentials and, if successful, redirects the user agent to the client's redirection endpoint.[¶](#section-4.12-1)

In \[\], the HTTP status code 302 (Found) is used for this purpose, but "any other method available via the user-agent to accomplish this redirection is allowed". When the status code 307 is used for redirection instead, the user agent will send the user's credentials via HTTP POST to the client.[¶](#section-4.12-2)

This discloses the sensitive credentials to the client. If the client is malicious, it can use the credentials to impersonate the user at the authorization server.[¶](#section-4.12-3)

The behavior might be unexpected for developers but is defined in [Section 15.4.8](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.4.8) of \[\]. This status code (307) does not require the user agent to rewrite the POST request to a GET request and thereby drop the form data in the POST request body.[¶](#section-4.12-4)

In the HTTP standard \[\], only the status code 303 unambiguously enforces rewriting the HTTP POST request to an HTTP GET request. For all other status codes, including the popular 302, user agents can opt not to rewrite POST to GET requests, thereby causing the user's credentials to be revealed to the client. (In practice, however, most user agents will only show this behavior for 307 redirects.) [¶](#section-4.12-5)

Authorization servers that redirect a request that potentially contains the user's credentials therefore MUST NOT use the HTTP 307 status code for redirection. If an HTTP redirection (and not, for example, JavaScript) is used for such a request, the authorization server SHOULD use HTTP status code 303 (See Other).[¶](#section-4.12-6)

### 4.13.

A common deployment architecture for HTTP applications is to hide the application server behind a reverse proxy that terminates the TLS connection and dispatches the incoming requests to the respective application server nodes.[¶](#section-4.13-1)

This section highlights some attack angles of this deployment architecture with relevance to OAuth and gives recommendations for security controls.[¶](#section-4.13-2)

In some situations, the reverse proxy needs to pass security-related data to the upstream application servers for further processing. Examples include the IP address of the request originator, token-binding IDs, and authenticated TLS client certificates. This data is usually passed in HTTP headers added to the upstream request. While the headers are often custom, application-specific headers, standardized header fields for client certificates and client certificate chains are defined in \[\].[¶](#section-4.13-3)

If the reverse proxy passes through any header sent from the outside, an attacker could try to directly send the faked header values through the proxy to the application server in order to circumvent security controls that way. For example, it is standard practice of reverse proxies to accept `X-Forwarded-For` headers and just add the origin of the inbound request (making it a list). Depending on the logic performed in the application server, the attacker could simply add an allowed IP address to the header and render the protection useless.[¶](#section-4.13-4)

A reverse proxy MUST therefore sanitize any inbound requests to ensure the authenticity and integrity of all header values relevant for the security of the application servers.[¶](#section-4.13-5)

If an attacker were able to get access to the internal network between the proxy and application server, the attacker could also try to circumvent security controls in place. Therefore, it is essential to ensure the authenticity of the communicating entities. Furthermore, the communication link between the reverse proxy and application server MUST be protected against eavesdropping, injection, and replay of messages.[¶](#section-4.13-6)

### 4.14.

Refresh tokens are a convenient and user-friendly way to obtain new access tokens. They also add to the security of OAuth, since they allow the authorization server to issue access tokens with a short lifetime and reduced scope, thus reducing the potential impact of access token leakage.[¶](#section-4.14-1)

### 4.15.

Resource servers may make access control decisions based on the identity of a resource owner for which an access token was issued, or based on the identity of a client in the client credentials grant. For example, \[\] (JSON Web Token (JWT) [[Profile]] for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens) describes a data structure for access tokens containing a `sub` claim defined as follows:[¶](#section-4.15-1)

> In cases of access tokens obtained through grants where a resource owner is involved, such as the authorization code grant, the value of "sub" SHOULD correspond to the subject identifier of the resource owner. In cases of access tokens obtained through grants where no resource owner is involved, such as the client credentials grant, the value of "sub" SHOULD correspond to an identifier the authorization server uses to indicate the client application.[¶](#section-4.15-2.1)

If both options are possible, a resource server may mistake a client's identity for the identity of a resource owner. For example, if a client is able to choose its own `client_id` during registration with the authorization server, a malicious client may set it to a value identifying a resource owner (e.g., a `sub` value if [[OpenID Connect]] is used). If the resource server cannot properly distinguish between access tokens obtained with involvement of the resource owner and those without, the client may accidentally be able to access resources belonging to the resource owner.[¶](#section-4.15-3)

This attack potentially affects not only implementations using \[\], but also similar, bespoke solutions.[¶](#section-4.15-4)

#### 4.15.1.

Authorization servers SHOULD NOT allow clients to influence their `client_id` or any other claim that could cause confusion with a genuine resource owner if a common namespace for client IDs and user identifiers exists, such as in the `sub` claim example from \[\] shown in above. Where this cannot be avoided, authorization servers MUST provide other means for the resource server to distinguish between the two types of access tokens.[¶](#section-4.15.1-1)

### 4.16.

As described in [Section 4.4.1.9](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.9) of \[\], the authorization request is susceptible to clickjacking attacks, also called user interface redressing. In such an attack, an attacker embeds the authorization endpoint user interface in an innocuous context. A user believing to interact with that context, for example, by clicking on buttons, inadvertently interacts with the authorization endpoint user interface instead. The opposite can be achieved as well: A user believing to interact with the authorization endpoint might inadvertently type a password into an attacker-provided input field overlaid over the original user interface. Clickjacking attacks can be designed such that users can hardly notice the attack, for example, using almost invisible iframes overlaid on top of other elements.[¶](#section-4.16-1)

An attacker can use this vector to obtain the user's authentication credentials, change the scope of access granted to the client, and potentially access the user's resources.[¶](#section-4.16-2)

Authorization servers MUST prevent clickjacking attacks. Multiple countermeasures are described in \[\], including the use of the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header field and frame-busting JavaScript. In addition to those, authorization servers SHOULD also use Content Security Policy (CSP) level 2 \[\] or greater.[¶](#section-4.16-3)

To be effective, CSP must be used on the authorization endpoint and, if applicable, other endpoints used to authenticate the user and authorize the client (e.g., the device authorization endpoint, login pages, error pages, etc.). This prevents framing by unauthorized origins in user agents that support CSP. The client MAY permit being framed by some other origin than the one used in its redirection endpoint. For this reason, authorization servers SHOULD allow administrators to configure allowed origins for particular clients and/or for clients to register these dynamically.[¶](#section-4.16-4)

Using CSP allows authorization servers to specify multiple origins in a single response header field and to constrain these using flexible patterns (see \[\] for details). Level 2 of CSP provides a robust mechanism for protecting against clickjacking by using policies that restrict the origin of frames (by using `frame-ancestors`) together with those that restrict the sources of scripts allowed to execute on an HTML page (by using `script-src`). A non-normative example of such a policy is shown in the following listing:[¶](#section-4.16-5)

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://ext.example.org:8000
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://ext.example.org:8000
...
```
[¶](#section-4.16-6)

Because some user agents do not support \[\], this technique SHOULD be combined with others, including those described in \[\], unless such legacy user agents are explicitly unsupported by the authorization server. Even in such cases, additional countermeasures SHOULD still be employed.[¶](#section-4.16-7)

### 4.17.

If the authorization response is sent with in-browser communication techniques like postMessage \[\] instead of HTTP redirects, messages may inadvertently be sent to malicious origins or injected from malicious origins.[¶](#section-4.17-1)

#### 4.17.1.

The following non-normative pseudocode examples of attacks using in-browser communication are described in \[\].[¶](#section-4.17.1-1)

##### 4.17.1.1.

When sending the authorization response or token response via postMessage, the authorization server sends the response to the wildcard origin "\*" instead of the client's origin. When the window to which the response is sent is controlled by an attacker, the attacker can read the response.[¶](#section-4.17.1.1-1)

```javascript
window.opener.postMessage(
  {
    code: "ABC",
    state: "123"
  },
  "*" // any website in the opener window can receive the message
)
```
[¶](#section-4.17.1.1-2)

##### 4.17.1.2.

When sending the authorization response or token response via postMessage, the authorization server may not check the receiver origin against the redirection URI and instead, for example, may send the response to an origin provided by an attacker. This is analogous to the attack described in.[¶](#section-4.17.1.2-1)

```javascript
window.opener.postMessage(
  {
    code: "ABC",
    state: "123"
  },
  "https://attacker.example" // attacker-provided value
)
```
[¶](#section-4.17.1.2-2)

##### 4.17.1.3.

A client that expects the authorization response or token response via postMessage may not validate the sender origin of the message. This may allow an attacker to inject an authorization response or token response into the client.[¶](#section-4.17.1.3-1)

In the case of a maliciously injected authorization response, the attack is a variant of the CSRF attacks described in. The countermeasures described in apply to this attack as well.[¶](#section-4.17.1.3-2)

In the case of a maliciously injected token response, sender-constrained access tokens as described in may prevent the attack under some circumstances, but additional countermeasures as described in are generally required.[¶](#section-4.17.1.3-3)

#### 4.17.2.

When comparing client receiver origins against pre-registered origins, authorization servers MUST utilize exact string matching as described in. Authorization servers MUST send postMessages to trusted client receiver origins, as shown in the following, non-normative example:[¶](#section-4.17.2-1)

```javascript
window.opener.postMessage(
  {
    code: "ABC",
    state: "123"
  },
  "https://client.example" // use explicit client origin
)
```
[¶](#section-4.17.2-2)

Wildcard origins like "\*" in postMessage MUST NOT be used, as attackers can use them to leak a victim's in-browser message to malicious origins. Both measures contribute to the prevention of leakage of authorization codes and access tokens (see ).[¶](#section-4.17.2-3)

Clients MUST prevent injection of in-browser messages on the client receiver endpoint. Clients MUST utilize exact string matching to compare the initiator origin of an in-browser message with the authorization server origin, as shown in the following, non-normative example:[¶](#section-4.17.2-4)

```javascript
window.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
  // validate exact authorization server origin
  if (e.origin === "https://honest.as.example") {
    // process e.data.code and e.data.state
  }
})
```
[¶](#section-4.17.2-5)

Since in-browser communication flows only apply a different communication technique (i.e., postMessage instead of HTTP redirect), all measures protecting the authorization response listed in MUST be applied equally.[¶](#section-4.17.2-6)

In \[\], a threat model is laid out that describes the threats against which OAuth deployments must be protected. While doing so, \[\] makes certain assumptions about attackers and their capabilities, i.e., it implicitly establishes an attacker model. In the following, this attacker model is made explicit and is updated and expanded to account for the potentially dynamic relationships involving multiple parties (as described in ), to include new types of attackers, and to define the attacker model more clearly.[¶](#section-3-1)

The goal of this document is to ensure that the authorization of a resource owner (with a user agent) at an authorization server and the subsequent usage of the access token at a resource server is protected, as well as practically possible, at least against the following attackers.[¶](#section-3-2)

(A1)

Web attackers that can set up and operate an arbitrary number of network endpoints (besides the "honest" ones) including browsers and servers. Web attackers may set up websites that are visited by the resource owner, operate their own user agents, and participate in the protocol.[¶](#section-3-3.1.1)

In particular, web attackers may operate OAuth clients that are registered at the authorization server, and they may operate their own authorization and resource servers that can be used (in parallel to the "honest" ones) by the resource owner and other resource owners.[¶](#section-3-3.1.2)

It must also be assumed that web attackers can lure the user to navigate their browser to arbitrary attacker-chosen URIs at any time. In practice, this can be achieved in many ways, for example, by injecting malicious advertisements into advertisement networks or by sending legitimate-looking emails.[¶](#section-3-3.1.3)

Web attackers can use their own user credentials to create new messages as well as any secrets they learned previously. For example, if a web attacker learns an authorization code of a user through a misconfigured redirection URI, the web attacker can then try to redeem that code for an access token.[¶](#section-3-3.1.4)

They cannot, however, read or manipulate messages that are not targeted towards them (e.g., sent to a URL of an authorization server not under control of an attacker).[¶](#section-3-3.1.5) 

(A2)

Network attackers that additionally have full control over the network over which protocol participants communicate. They can eavesdrop on, manipulate, and spoof messages, except when these are properly protected by cryptographic methods (e.g., TLS). Network attackers can also block arbitrary messages.[¶](#section-3-3.2.1)

While an example for a web attacker would be a customer of an internet service provider, network attackers could be the internet service provider itself, an attacker in a public (Wi-Fi) network using ARP spoofing, or a state-sponsored attacker with access to internet exchange points, for instance.[¶](#section-3-4)

The aforementioned attackers and conform to the attacker model that was used in formal analysis efforts for OAuth \[\]. This is a minimal attacker model. Implementers MUST take into account all possible types of attackers in the environment of their OAuth implementations. For example, in \[\], a very strong attacker model is used that includes attackers that have full control over the token endpoint. This models effects of a possible misconfiguration of endpoints in the ecosystem, which can be avoided by using authorization server metadata as described in. Such an attacker is therefore not listed here.[¶](#section-3-5)

However, previous attacks on OAuth have shown that the following types of attackers are relevant in particular:[¶](#section-3-6)

(A3)

Attackers that can read, but not modify, the contents of the authorization response (i.e., the authorization response can leak to an attacker).[¶](#section-3-7.1.1)

Examples of such attacks include open redirector attacks and mix-up attacks (see ), where the client is tricked into sending credentials to an attacker-controlled authorization server.[¶](#section-3-7.1.2)

Also, this includes attacks that take advantage of:[¶](#section-3-7.1.3)

- insufficient checking of redirect URIs (see );[¶](#section-3-7.1.4.1)
- problems existing on mobile operating systems, where different apps can register themselves on the same URI; and [¶](#section-3-7.1.4.2)
- URLs stored/logged by browsers (history), proxy servers, and operating systems.[¶](#section-3-7.1.4.3)

(A4)

Attackers that can read, but not modify, the contents of the authorization request (i.e., the authorization request can leak, in the same manner as above, to an attacker).[¶](#section-3-7.2.1)

(A5)

Attackers that can acquire an access token issued by an authorization server. For example, a resource server may be compromised by an attacker, an access token may be sent to an attacker-controlled resource server due to a misconfiguration, or social engineering may be used to get a resource owner to use an attacker-controlled resource server. Also see.[¶](#section-3-7.3.1)

,, and typically occur together with either or. Attackers can collaborate to reach a common goal.[¶](#section-3-8)

Note that an Attacker or can be a resource owner or act as one. For example, such an attacker can use their own browser to replay tokens or authorization codes obtained by any of the attacks described above at the client or resource server.[¶](#section-3-9)

This document focuses on threats resulting from Attackers to.[¶](#section-3-10)

[^3]: ## 4.

This section gives a detailed description of attacks on OAuth implementations, along with potential countermeasures. Attacks and mitigations already covered in \[\] are not listed here, except where new recommendations are made.[¶](#section-4-1)

This section further defines additional requirements (beyond those defined in ) for certain cases and protocol options.[¶](#section-4-2) 

### 4.1.

Some authorization servers allow clients to register redirection URI patterns instead of complete redirection URIs. The authorization servers then match the redirection URI parameter value at the authorization endpoint against the registered patterns at runtime. This approach allows clients to encode transaction state into additional redirect URI parameters or to register a single pattern for multiple redirection URIs.[¶](#section-4.1-1)

This approach turned out to be more complex to implement and more error-prone to manage than exact redirection URI matching. Several successful attacks exploiting flaws in the pattern-matching implementation or concrete configurations have been observed in the wild (see, e.g., \[\]). Insufficient validation of the redirection URI effectively breaks client identification or authentication (depending on grant and client type) and allows the attacker to obtain an authorization code or access token, either [¶](#section-4.1-2)

- by directly sending the user agent to a URI under the attacker's control, or [¶](#section-4.1-3.1)
- by exposing the OAuth credentials to an attacker by utilizing an open redirector at the client in conjunction with the way user agents handle URL fragments.[¶](#section-4.1-3.2)

These attacks are shown in detail in the following subsections.[¶](#section-4.1-4)

#### 4.1.1.

For a client using the grant type `code`, an attack may work as follows:[¶](#section-4.1.1-1)

Assume the redirection URL pattern `https://*.somesite.example/*` is registered for the client with the client ID `s6BhdRkqt3`. The intention is to allow any subdomain of `somesite.example` to be a valid redirection URI for the client, for example, `https://app1.somesite.example/redirect`. However, a naive implementation on the authorization server might interpret the wildcard `*` as "any character" and not "any character valid for a domain name". The authorization server, therefore, might permit `https://attacker.example/.somesite.example` as a redirection URI, although `attacker.example` is a different domain potentially controlled by a malicious party.[¶](#section-4.1.1-2)

The attack can then be conducted as follows:[¶](#section-4.1.1-3)

To begin, the attacker needs to trick the user into opening a tampered URL in their browser that launches a page under the attacker's control, say, `https://www.evil.example` (see attacker in ).[¶](#section-4.1.1-4)

This URL initiates the following authorization request with the client ID of a legitimate client to the authorization endpoint (line breaks for display only):[¶](#section-4.1.1-5)

```
GET /authorize?response_type=code&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=9ad67f13
     &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fattacker.example%2F.somesite.example
     HTTP/1.1
Host: server.somesite.example
```
[¶](#section-4.1.1-6)

The authorization server validates the redirection URI and compares it to the registered redirection URL patterns for the client `s6BhdRkqt3`. The authorization request is processed and presented to the user.[¶](#section-4.1.1-7)

If the user does not see the redirection URI or does not recognize the attack, the code is issued and immediately sent to the attacker's domain. If an automatic approval of the authorization is enabled (which is not recommended for public clients according to \[\]), the attack can be performed even without user interaction.[¶](#section-4.1.1-8)

If the attacker impersonates a public client, the attacker can exchange the code for tokens at the respective token endpoint.[¶](#section-4.1.1-9)

This attack will not work as easily for confidential clients, since the code exchange requires authentication with the legitimate client's secret. However, the attacker can use the legitimate confidential client to redeem the code by performing an authorization code injection attack; see.[¶](#section-4.1.1-10)

It is important to note that redirection URI validation vulnerabilities can also exist if the authorization server handles wildcards properly. For example, assume that the client registers the redirection URL pattern `https://*.somesite.example/*` and the authorization server interprets this as "allow redirection URIs pointing to any host residing in the domain `somesite.example` ". If an attacker manages to establish a host or subdomain in `somesite.example`, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate client. For example, this could be caused by a subdomain takeover attack \[\], where an outdated CNAME record (say, `external-service.somesite.example`) points to an external DNS name that no longer exists (say, `customer-abc.service.example`) and can be taken over by an attacker (e.g., by registering as `customer-abc` with the external service).[¶](#section-4.1.1-11)

#### 4.1.2.

The attack described above works for the implicit grant as well. If the attacker is able to send the authorization response to an attacker-controlled URI, the attacker will directly get access to the fragment carrying the access token.[¶](#section-4.1.2-1)

Additionally, implicit grants (and also other grants when using `response_mode=fragment` as defined in \[\]) can be subject to a further kind of attack. The attack utilizes the fact that user agents reattach fragments to the destination URL of a redirect if the location header does not contain a fragment (see [Section 17.11](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-17.11) of \[\]). The attack described here combines this behavior with the client as an open redirector (see ) in order to obtain access tokens. This allows circumvention even of very narrow redirection URI patterns, but not of strict URL matching.[¶](#section-4.1.2-2)

Assume the registered URL pattern for client `s6BhdRkqt3` is `https://client.somesite.example/cb?*`, i.e., any parameter is allowed for redirects to `https://client.somesite.example/cb`. Unfortunately, the client exposes an open redirector. This endpoint supports a parameter `redirect_to` which takes a target URL and will send the browser to this URL using an HTTP Location header redirect 303.[¶](#section-4.1.2-3)

The attack can now be conducted as follows:[¶](#section-4.1.2-4)

To begin, as above, the attacker needs to trick the user into opening a tampered URL in their browser that launches a page under the attacker's control, say, `https://www.evil.example`.[¶](#section-4.1.2-5)

Afterwards, the website initiates an authorization request that is very similar to the one in the attack on the code flow. Different to above, it utilizes the open redirector by encoding `redirect_to=https://attacker.example` into the parameters of the redirection URI, and it uses the response type `token` (line breaks for display only):[¶](#section-4.1.2-6)

```
GET /authorize?response_type=token&state=9ad67f13
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.somesite.example
     %2Fcb%26redirect_to%253Dhttps%253A%252F
     %252Fattacker.example%252F HTTP/1.1
Host: server.somesite.example
```
[¶](#section-4.1.2-7)

Then, since the redirection URI matches the registered pattern, the authorization server permits the request and sends the resulting access token in a 303 redirect (some response parameters omitted for readability):[¶](#section-4.1.2-8)

```
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Location: https://client.somesite.example/cb?
          redirect_to%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fattacker.example%2Fcb
          #access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA&...
```
[¶](#section-4.1.2-9)

At client.somesite.example, the request arrives at the open redirector. The endpoint will read the redirect parameter and will issue an HTTP 303 Location header redirect to the URL `https://attacker.example/`.[¶](#section-4.1.2-10)

```
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Location: https://attacker.example/
```
[¶](#section-4.1.2-11)

Since the redirector at client.somesite.example does not include a fragment in the Location header, the user agent will reattach the original fragment `#access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA&amp;...` to the URL and will navigate to the following URL:[¶](#section-4.1.2-12)

```
https://attacker.example/#access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1z...
```
[¶](#section-4.1.2-13)

The attacker's page at `attacker.example` can then access the fragment and obtain the access token.[¶](#section-4.1.2-14)

#### 4.1.3.

The complexity of implementing and managing pattern matching correctly obviously causes security issues. This document therefore advises simplifying the required logic and configuration by using exact redirection URI matching. This means the authorization server MUST ensure that the two URIs are equal; see [Section 6.2.1](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-6.2.1) of \[\], Simple String Comparison, for details. The only exception is native apps using a `localhost` URI: In this case, the authorization server MUST allow variable port numbers as described in [Section 7.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252#section-7.3) of \[\].[¶](#section-4.1.3-1)

Additional recommendations:[¶](#section-4.1.3-2)

- Web servers on which redirection URIs are hosted MUST NOT expose open redirectors (see ).[¶](#section-4.1.3-3.1)
- Browsers reattach URL fragments to Location redirection URLs only if the URL in the Location header does not already contain a fragment. Therefore, servers MAY prevent browsers from reattaching fragments to redirection URLs by attaching an arbitrary fragment identifier, for example `#_`, to URLs in Location headers.[¶](#section-4.1.3-3.2)
- Clients SHOULD use the authorization code response type instead of response types that cause access token issuance at the authorization endpoint. This offers countermeasures against the reuse of leaked credentials through the exchange process with the authorization server and against token replay through sender-constraining of the access tokens.[¶](#section-4.1.3-3.3)

If the origin and integrity of the authorization request containing the redirection URI can be verified, for example, when using \[\] or \[\] with client authentication, the authorization server MAY trust the redirection URI without further checks.[¶](#section-4.1.3-4)

### 4.2.

The contents of the authorization request URI or the authorization response URI can unintentionally be disclosed to attackers through the Referer HTTP header (see [Section 10.1.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-10.1.3) of \[\]), by leaking from either the authorization server's or the client's website, respectively. Most importantly, authorization codes or `state` values can be disclosed in this way. Although specified otherwise in [Section 10.1.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-10.1.3) of \[\], the same may happen to access tokens conveyed in URI fragments due to browser implementation issues, as illustrated by a (now fixed) issue in the Chromium project \[\].[¶](#section-4.2-1)

#### 4.2.1.

Leakage from the OAuth client requires that the client, as a result of a successful authorization request, renders a page that [¶](#section-4.2.1-1)

- contains links to other pages under the attacker's control and a user clicks on such a link, or [¶](#section-4.2.1-2.1)
- includes third-party content (advertisements in iframes, images, etc.), for example, if the page contains user-generated content (blog).[¶](#section-4.2.1-2.2)

As soon as the browser navigates to the attacker's page or loads the third-party content, the attacker receives the authorization response URL and can extract `code` or `state` (and potentially `access_token`).[¶](#section-4.2.1-3)

#### 4.2.2.

In a similar way, an attacker can learn `state` from the authorization request if the authorization endpoint at the authorization server contains links or third-party content as above.[¶](#section-4.2.2-1)

#### 4.2.3.

An attacker that learns a valid code or access token through a Referer header can perform the attacks as described in Sections, and. If the attacker learns `state`, the CSRF protection achieved by using `state` is lost, resulting in CSRF attacks as described in [Section 4.4.1.8](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.8) of \[\].[¶](#section-4.2.3-1)

#### 4.2.4.

The page rendered as a result of the OAuth authorization response and the authorization endpoint SHOULD NOT include third-party resources or links to external sites.[¶](#section-4.2.4-1)

The following measures further reduce the chances of a successful attack:[¶](#section-4.2.4-2)

- Suppress the Referer header by applying an appropriate Referrer Policy \[\] to the document (either as part of the "referrer" meta attribute or by setting a Referrer-Policy header). For example, the header `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` in the response completely suppresses the Referer header in all requests originating from the resulting document.[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.1)
- Use authorization code instead of response types causing access token issuance from the authorization endpoint.[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.2)
- Bind the authorization code to a confidential client or PKCE challenge. In this case, the attacker lacks the secret to request the code exchange.[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.3)
- As described in [Section 4.1.2](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.1.2) of \[\], authorization codes MUST be invalidated by the authorization server after their first use at the token endpoint. For example, if an authorization server invalidated the code after the legitimate client redeemed it, the attacker would fail to exchange this code later.[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.4.1)
	This does not mitigate the attack if the attacker manages to exchange the code for a token before the legitimate client does so. Therefore, \[\] further recommends that, when an attempt is made to redeem a code twice, the authorization server SHOULD revoke all tokens issued previously based on that code.[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.4.2)
- The `state` value SHOULD be invalidated by the client after its first use at the redirection endpoint. If this is implemented, and an attacker receives a token through the Referer header from the client's website, the `state` was already used, invalidated by the client and cannot be used again by the attacker. (This does not help if the `state` leaks from the authorization server's website, since then the `state` has not been used at the redirection endpoint at the client yet.) [¶](#section-4.2.4-3.5.1)
- Use the form post response mode instead of a redirect for the authorization response (see \[\]).[¶](#section-4.2.4-3.6.1)

### 4.3.

Authorization codes and access tokens can end up in the browser's history of visited URLs, enabling the attacks described in the following.[¶](#section-4.3-1)

#### 4.3.1.

When a browser navigates to `client.example/redirection_endpoint?code=abcd` as a result of a redirect from a provider's authorization endpoint, the URL including the authorization code may end up in the browser's history. An attacker with access to the device could obtain the code and try to replay it.[¶](#section-4.3.1-1)

Countermeasures:[¶](#section-4.3.1-2)

- Authorization code replay prevention as described in [Section 4.4.1.1](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.1) of \[\], and.[¶](#section-4.3.1-3.1)
- Use the form post response mode instead of redirect for the authorization response (see \[\]).[¶](#section-4.3.1-3.2)

#### 4.3.2.

An access token may end up in the browser history if a client or a website that already has a token deliberately navigates to a page like `provider.com/get_user_profile?access_token=abcdef`. \[\] discourages this practice and advises transferring tokens via a header, but in practice websites often pass access tokens in query parameters.[¶](#section-4.3.2-1)

In the case of implicit grant, a URL like `client.example/redirection_endpoint#access_token=abcdef` may also end up in the browser history as a result of a redirect from a provider's authorization endpoint.[¶](#section-4.3.2-2)

Countermeasures:[¶](#section-4.3.2-3)

- Clients MUST NOT pass access tokens in a URI query parameter in the way described in [Section 2.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750#section-2.3) of \[\]. The authorization code grant or alternative OAuth response modes like the form post response mode \[\] can be used to this end.[¶](#section-4.3.2-4.1)

### 4.4.

Mix-up attacks can occur in scenarios where an OAuth client interacts with two or more authorization servers and at least one authorization server is under the control of the attacker. This can be the case, for example, if the attacker uses dynamic registration to register the client at their own authorization server or if an authorization server becomes compromised.[¶](#section-4.4-1)

The goal of the attack is to obtain an authorization code or an access token for an uncompromised authorization server. This is achieved by tricking the client into sending those credentials to the compromised authorization server (the attacker) instead of using them at the respective endpoint of the uncompromised authorization/resource server.[¶](#section-4.4-2)

#### 4.4.1.

The description here follows \[\], with variants of the attack outlined below.[¶](#section-4.4.1-1)

Preconditions: For this variant of the attack to work, it is assumed that [¶](#section-4.4.1-2)

- the implicit or authorization code grant is used with multiple authorization servers of which one is considered "honest" (H-AS) and one is operated by the attacker (A-AS), and [¶](#section-4.4.1-3.1)
- the client stores the authorization server chosen by the user in a session bound to the user's browser and uses the same redirection URI for each authorization server.[¶](#section-4.4.1-3.2)

In the following, it is further assumed that the client is registered with H-AS (URI: `https://honest.as.example`, client ID: `7ZGZldHQ`) and with A-AS (URI: `https://attacker.example`, client ID: `666RVZJTA`). URLs shown in the following example are shortened for presentation to include only parameters relevant to the attack.[¶](#section-4.4.1-4)

Attack on the authorization code grant:[¶](#section-4.4.1-5)

1. The user selects to start the grant using A-AS (e.g., by clicking on a button on the client's website).[¶](#section-4.4.1-6.1)
2. The client stores in the user's session that the user selected "A-AS" and redirects the user to A-AS's authorization endpoint with a Location header containing the URL `https://attacker.example/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=666RVZJTA`.[¶](#step_2_mixup)
3. When the user's browser navigates to the attacker's authorization endpoint, the attacker immediately redirects the browser to the authorization endpoint of H-AS. In the authorization request, the attacker replaces the client ID of the client at A-AS with the client's ID at H-AS. Therefore, the browser receives a redirection (303 See Other) with a Location header pointing to `https://honest.as.example/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=7ZGZldHQ` [¶](#section-4.4.1-6.3)
4. The user authorizes the client to access their resources at H-AS. (Note that a vigilant user might at this point detect that they intended to use A-AS instead of H-AS. The first attack variant listed does not have this limitation.) H-AS issues a code and sends it (via the browser) back to the client.[¶](#section-4.4.1-6.4.1)
5. Since the client still assumes that the code was issued by A-AS, it will try to redeem the code at A-AS's token endpoint.[¶](#section-4.4.1-6.5.1)
6. The attacker therefore obtains code and can either exchange the code for an access token (for public clients) or perform an authorization code injection attack as described in.[¶](#section-4.4.1-6.6.1)

Variants:[¶](#section-4.4.1-7)

- Mix-Up with Interception: This variant works only if the attacker can intercept and manipulate the first request/response pair from a user's browser to the client (in which the user selects a certain authorization server and is then redirected by the client to that authorization server), as in (see ). This capability can, for example, be the result of an attacker-in-the-middle attack on the user's connection to the client. In the attack, the user starts the flow with H-AS. The attacker intercepts this request and changes the user's selection to A-AS. The rest of the attack proceeds as in and following above.[¶](#section-4.4.1-8.1)
- Implicit Grant: In the implicit grant, the attacker receives an access token instead of the code in. The attacker's authorization server receives the access token when the client makes either a request to the A-AS userinfo endpoint (defined in \[\]) or a request to the attacker's resource server (since the client believes it has completed the flow with A-AS).[¶](#section-4.4.1-8.2)
- Per-AS Redirect URIs: If clients use different redirection URIs for different authorization servers, clients do not store the selected authorization server in the user's session, and authorization servers do not check the redirection URIs properly, attackers can mount an attack called "Cross Social-Network Request Forgery". These attacks have been observed in practice. Refer to \[\] for details.[¶](#section-4.4.1-8.3)
- [[OpenID Connect]]: Some variants can be used to attack [[OpenID Connect]]. In these attacks, the attacker misuses features of the [[OpenID Connect]] Discovery \[\] mechanism or replays access tokens or ID Tokens to conduct a mix-up attack. The attacks are described in detail in Appendix A of \[\] and Section 6 of \[\] ("Malicious Endpoints Attacks").[¶](#section-4.4.1-8.4)

#### 4.4.2.

When an OAuth client can only interact with one authorization server, a mix-up defense is not required. In scenarios where an OAuth client interacts with two or more authorization servers, however, clients MUST prevent mix-up attacks. Two different methods are discussed below.[¶](#section-4.4.2-1)

For both defenses, clients MUST store, for each authorization request, the issuer they sent the authorization request to and bind this information to the user agent. The issuer serves, via the associated metadata, as an abstract identifier for the combination of the authorization endpoint and token endpoint that are to be used in the flow. If an issuer identifier is not available (for example, if neither OAuth Authorization Server Metadata \[\] nor [[OpenID Connect]] Discovery \[\] is used), a different unique identifier for this tuple or the tuple itself can be used instead. For brevity of presentation, such a deployment-specific identifier will be subsumed under the issuer (or issuer identifier) in the following.[¶](#section-4.4.2-2)

It is important to note that just storing the authorization server URL is not sufficient to identify mix-up attacks. An attacker might declare an uncompromised authorization server's authorization endpoint URL as "their" authorization server URL, but declare a token endpoint under their own control.[¶](#section-4.4.2-3)

##### 4.4.2.1.

This defense requires that the authorization server sends its issuer identifier in the authorization response to the client. When receiving the authorization response, the client MUST compare the received issuer identifier to the stored issuer identifier. If there is a mismatch, the client MUST abort the interaction.[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-1)

There are different ways this issuer identifier can be transported to the client:[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-2)

- The issuer information can be transported, for example, via a separate response parameter `iss`, defined in \[\].[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-3.1)
- When [[OpenID Connect]] is used and an ID Token is returned in the authorization response, the client can evaluate the `iss` claim in the ID Token.[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-3.2)

In both cases, the `iss` value MUST be evaluated according to \[\].[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-4)

While this defense may require deploying new OAuth features to transport the issuer information, it is a robust and relatively simple defense against mix-up.[¶](#section-4.4.2.1-5)

##### 4.4.2.2.

For this defense, clients MUST use a distinct redirection URI for each issuer they interact with.[¶](#section-4.4.2.2-1)

Clients MUST check that the authorization response was received from the correct issuer by comparing the distinct redirection URI for the issuer to the URI where the authorization response was received on. If there is a mismatch, the client MUST abort the flow.[¶](#section-4.4.2.2-2)

While this defense builds upon existing OAuth functionality, it cannot be used in scenarios where clients only register once for the use of many different issuers (as in some open banking schemes) and due to the tight integration with the client registration, it is harder to deploy automatically.[¶](#section-4.4.2.2-3)

Furthermore, an attacker might be able to circumvent the protection offered by this defense by registering a new client with the "honest" authorization server using the redirect URI that the client assigned to the attacker's authorization server. The attacker could then run the attack as described above, replacing the client ID with the client ID of their newly created client.[¶](#section-4.4.2.2-4)

This defense SHOULD therefore only be used if other options are not available.[¶](#section-4.4.2.2-5)

### 4.5.

An attacker who has gained access to an authorization code contained in an authorization response (see in ) can try to redeem the authorization code for an access token or otherwise make use of the authorization code.[¶](#section-4.5-1)

In the case that the authorization code was created for a public client, the attacker can send the authorization code to the token endpoint of the authorization server and thereby get an access token. This attack was described in [Section 4.4.1.1](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.1) of \[\].[¶](#section-4.5-2)

For confidential clients, or in some special situations, the attacker can execute an authorization code injection attack, as described in the following.[¶](#section-4.5-3)

In an authorization code injection attack, the attacker attempts to inject a stolen authorization code into the attacker's own session with the client. The aim is to associate the attacker's session at the client with the victim's resources or identity, thereby giving the attacker at least limited access to the victim's resources.[¶](#section-4.5-4)

Besides circumventing the client authentication of confidential clients, other use cases for this attack include:[¶](#section-4.5-5)

- The attacker wants to access certain functions in this particular client. As an example, the attacker wants to impersonate their victim in a certain app or on a certain website.[¶](#section-4.5-6.1)
- The authorization or resource servers are limited to certain networks that the attacker is unable to access directly.[¶](#section-4.5-6.2)

Except in these special cases, authorization code injection is usually not interesting when the code is created for a public client, as sending the code to the token endpoint is a simpler and more powerful attack, as described above.[¶](#section-4.5-7)

#### 4.5.1.

The authorization code injection attack works as follows:[¶](#section-4.5.1-1)

1. The attacker obtains an authorization code (see in ). For the rest of the attack, only the capabilities of a web attacker are required.[¶](#section-4.5.1-2.1)
2. From the attacker's device, the attacker starts a regular OAuth authorization process with the legitimate client.[¶](#step_2_code_injection)
3. In the response of the authorization server to the legitimate client, the attacker replaces the newly created authorization code with the stolen authorization code. Since this response is passing through the attacker's device, the attacker can use any tool that can intercept and manipulate the authorization response to this end. The attacker does not need to control the network.[¶](#step_3_code_injection)
4. The legitimate client sends the code to the authorization server's token endpoint, along with the `redirect_uri` and the client's client ID and client secret (or other means of client authentication).[¶](#section-4.5.1-2.4)
5. The authorization server checks the client secret, whether the code was issued to the particular client, and whether the actual redirection URI matches the `redirect_uri` parameter (see \[\]).[¶](#checkin)
6. All checks succeed and the authorization server issues access and other tokens to the client. The attacker has now associated their session with the legitimate client with the victim's resources and/or identity.[¶](#section-4.5.1-2.6)

#### 4.5.3.

There are two good technical solutions to binding authorization codes to client instances, as follows.[¶](#section-4.5.3-1)

##### 4.5.3.1.

The PKCE mechanism specified in \[\] can be used as a countermeasure (even though it was originally designed to secure native apps). When the attacker attempts to inject an authorization code, the check of the `code_verifier` fails: the client uses its correct verifier, but the code is associated with a `code_challenge` that does not match this verifier.[¶](#section-4.5.3.1-1)

PKCE not only protects against the authorization code injection attack but also protects authorization codes created for public clients: PKCE ensures that an attacker cannot redeem a stolen authorization code at the token endpoint of the authorization server without knowledge of the `code_verifier`.[¶](#section-4.5.3.1-2)

##### 4.5.3.2.

[[OpenID Connect]]'s existing `nonce` parameter can protect against authorization code injection attacks. The `nonce` value is one-time use and is created by the client. The client is supposed to bind it to the user agent session and send it with the initial request to the OpenID Provider (OP). The OP puts the received `nonce` value into the ID Token that is issued as part of the code exchange at the token endpoint. If an attacker injects an authorization code in the authorization response, the nonce value in the client session and the `nonce` value in the ID Token received from the token endpoint will not match, and the attack is detected. The assumption is that an attacker cannot get hold of the user agent state on the victim's device (from which the attacker has stolen the respective authorization code).[¶](#section-4.5.3.2-1)

It is important to note that this countermeasure only works if the client properly checks the `nonce` parameter in the ID Token obtained from the token endpoint and does not use any issued token until this check has succeeded. More precisely, a client protecting itself against code injection using the `nonce` parameter [¶](#section-4.5.3.2-2)

1. MUST validate the `nonce` in the ID Token obtained from the token endpoint, even if another ID Token was obtained from the authorization response (e.g., `response_type=code+id_token`), and [¶](#section-4.5.3.2-3.1)
2. MUST ensure that, unless and until that check succeeds, all tokens (ID Tokens and the access token) are disregarded and not used for any other purpose.[¶](#section-4.5.3.2-3.2)

It is important to note that `nonce` does not protect authorization codes of public clients, as an attacker does not need to execute an authorization code injection attack. Instead, an attacker can directly call the token endpoint with the stolen authorization code.[¶](#section-4.5.3.2-4)

##### 4.5.3.3.

Other solutions like binding `state` to the code, sender-constraining the code using cryptographic means, or per-instance client credentials are conceivable, but lack support and bring new security requirements.[¶](#section-4.5.3.3-1)

PKCE is the most obvious solution for OAuth clients, as it is available at the time of writing, while `nonce` is appropriate for [[OpenID Connect]] clients.[¶](#section-4.5.3.3-2)

#### 4.5.4.

An attacker can circumvent the countermeasures described above if they can modify the `nonce` or `code_challenge` values that are used in the victim's authorization request. The attacker can modify these values to be the same ones as those chosen by the client in their own session in of the attack above. (This requires that the victim's session with the client begins after the attacker started their session with the client.) If the attacker is then able to capture the authorization code from the victim, the attacker will be able to inject the stolen code in even if PKCE or `nonce` are used.[¶](#section-4.5.4-1)

This attack is complex and requires a close interaction between the attacker and the victim's session. Nonetheless, measures to prevent attackers from reading the contents of the authorization response still need to be taken, as described in Sections,,,, and.[¶](#section-4.5.4-2)

### 4.6.

In an access token injection attack, the attacker attempts to inject a stolen access token into a legitimate client (that is not under the attacker's control). This will typically happen if the attacker wants to utilize a leaked access token to impersonate a user in a certain client.[¶](#section-4.6-1)

To conduct the attack, the attacker starts an OAuth flow with the client using the implicit grant and modifies the authorization response by replacing the access token issued by the authorization server or directly making up an authorization server response including the leaked access token. Since the response includes the `state` value generated by the client for this particular transaction, the client does not treat the response as a CSRF attack and uses the access token injected by the attacker.[¶](#section-4.6-2)

#### 4.6.1.

There is no way to detect such an injection attack in pure-OAuth flows since the token is issued without any binding to the transaction or the particular user agent.[¶](#section-4.6.1-1)

In [[OpenID Connect]], the attack can be mitigated, as the authorization response additionally contains an ID Token containing the `at_hash` claim. The attacker therefore needs to replace both the access token as well as the ID Token in the response. The attacker cannot forge the ID Token, as it is signed or encrypted with authentication. The attacker also cannot inject a leaked ID Token matching the stolen access token, as the `nonce` claim in the leaked ID Token will contain (with a very high probability) a different value than the one expected in the authorization response.[¶](#section-4.6.1-2)

Note that further protection, like sender-constrained access tokens, is still required to prevent attackers from using the access token at the resource endpoint directly.[¶](#section-4.6.1-3)

The recommendations in follow from this.[¶](#section-4.6.1-4)

### 4.7.

An attacker might attempt to inject a request to the redirection URI of the legitimate client on the victim's device, e.g., to cause the client to access resources under the attacker's control. This is a variant of an attack known as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).[¶](#section-4.7-1)

#### 4.7.1.

The long-established countermeasure is that clients pass a random value, also known as a CSRF Token, in the `state` parameter that links the request to the redirection URI to the user agent session as described. This countermeasure is described in detail in [Section 5.3.5](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6819#section-5.3.5) of \[\]. The same protection is provided by PKCE or the [[OpenID Connect]] `nonce` value.[¶](#section-4.7.1-1)

When using PKCE instead of `state` or `nonce` for CSRF protection, it is important to note that:[¶](#section-4.7.1-2)

- Clients MUST ensure that the authorization server supports PKCE before using PKCE for CSRF protection. If an authorization server does not support PKCE, `state` or `nonce` MUST be used for CSRF protection.[¶](#section-4.7.1-3.1.1)
- If `state` is used for carrying application state, and the integrity of its contents is a concern, clients MUST protect `state` against tampering and swapping. This can be achieved by binding the contents of state to the browser session and/or by signing/encrypting state values. One example of this is discussed in the expired Internet-Draft \[\].[¶](#section-4.7.1-3.2.1)

The authorization server therefore MUST provide a way to detect their support for PKCE. Using Authorization Server Metadata according to \[\] is RECOMMENDED, but authorization servers MAY instead provide a deployment-specific way to ensure or determine PKCE support.[¶](#section-4.7.1-4)

PKCE provides robust protection against CSRF attacks even in the presence of an attacker that can read the authorization response (see in ). When `state` is used or an ID Token is returned in the authorization response (e.g., `response_type=code+id_token`), the attacker either learns the `state` value and can replay it into the forged authorization response, or can extract the `nonce` from the ID Token and use it in a new request to the authorization server to mint an ID Token with the same `nonce`. The new ID Token can then be used for the CSRF attack.[¶](#section-4.7.1-5)

### 4.8.

An authorization server that supports PKCE but does not make its use mandatory for all flows can be susceptible to a PKCE downgrade attack.[¶](#section-4.8-1)

The first prerequisite for this attack is that there is an attacker-controllable flag in the authorization request that enables or disables PKCE for the particular flow. The presence or absence of the `code_challenge` parameter lends itself for this purpose, i.e., the authorization server enables and enforces PKCE if this parameter is present in the authorization request, but it does not enforce PKCE if the parameter is missing.[¶](#section-4.8-2)

The second prerequisite for this attack is that the client is not using `state` at all (e.g., because the client relies on PKCE for CSRF prevention) or that the client is not checking `state` correctly.[¶](#section-4.8-3)

Roughly speaking, this attack is a variant of a CSRF attack. The attacker achieves the same goal as in the attack described in: The attacker injects an authorization code (and with that, an access token) that is bound to the attacker's resources into a session between their victim and the client.[¶](#section-4.8-4)

#### 4.8.1.

1. The user has started an OAuth session using some client at an authorization server. In the authorization request, the client has set the parameter `code_challenge=hash(abc)` as the PKCE code challenge (with the hash function and parameter encoding as defined in \[\]). The client is now waiting to receive the authorization response from the user's browser.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.1)
2. To conduct the attack, the attacker uses their own device to start an authorization flow with the targeted client. The client now uses another PKCE code challenge, say, `code_challenge=hash(xyz)`, in the authorization request. The attacker intercepts the request and removes the entire `code_challenge` parameter from the request. Since this step is performed on the attacker's device, the attacker has full access to the request contents, for example, using browser debug tools.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.2)
3. If the authorization server allows for flows without PKCE, it will create a code that is not bound to any PKCE code challenge.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.3)
4. The attacker now redirects the user's browser to an authorization response URL that contains the code for the attacker's session with the authorization server.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.4)
5. The user's browser sends the authorization code to the client, which will now try to redeem the code for an access token at the authorization server. The client will send `code_verifier=abc` as the PKCE code verifier in the token request.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.5)
6. Since the authorization server sees that this code is not bound to any PKCE code challenge, it will not check the presence or contents of the `code_verifier` parameter. It will issue an access token (which belongs to the attacker's resource) to the client under the user's control.[¶](#section-4.8.1-1.6)

#### 4.8.2.

Using `state` properly would prevent this attack. However, practice has shown that many OAuth clients do not use or check `state` properly.[¶](#section-4.8.2-1)

Therefore, authorization servers MUST mitigate this attack.[¶](#section-4.8.2-2)

Note that from the view of the authorization server, in the attack described above, a `code_verifier` parameter is received at the token endpoint although no `code_challenge` parameter was present in the authorization request for the OAuth flow in which the authorization code was issued.[¶](#section-4.8.2-3)

This fact can be used to mitigate this attack. \[\] already mandates that [¶](#section-4.8.2-4)

- an authorization server that supports PKCE MUST check whether a code challenge is contained in the authorization request and bind this information to the code that is issued; and [¶](#section-4.8.2-5.1)
- when a code arrives at the token endpoint, and there was a `code_challenge` in the authorization request for which this code was issued, there must be a valid `code_verifier` in the token request.[¶](#section-4.8.2-5.2)

Beyond this, to prevent PKCE downgrade attacks, the authorization server MUST ensure that if there was no `code_challenge` in the authorization request, a request to the token endpoint containing a `code_verifier` is rejected.[¶](#section-4.8.2-6)

Authorization servers that mandate the use of PKCE (in general or for particular clients) implicitly implement this security measure.[¶](#section-4.8.2-7)

### 4.9.

Access tokens can leak from a resource server under certain circumstances.[¶](#section-4.9-1)

#### 4.9.1.

An attacker may set up their own resource server and trick a client into sending access tokens to it that are valid for other resource servers (see Attackers and in ). If the client sends a valid access token to this counterfeit resource server, the attacker in turn may use that token to access other services on behalf of the resource owner.[¶](#section-4.9.1-1)

This attack assumes the client is not bound to one specific resource server (and its URL) at development time, but client instances are provided with the resource server URL at runtime. This kind of late binding is typical in situations where the client uses a service implementing a standardized API (e.g., for email, calendaring, eHealth, or open banking) and where the client is configured by a user or administrator.[¶](#section-4.9.1-2)

#### 4.9.2.

An attacker may compromise a resource server to gain access to the resources of the respective deployment. Such a compromise may range from partial access to the system, e.g., its log files, to full control over the respective server, in which case all controls can be circumvented and all resources can be accessed. The attacker would also be able to obtain other access tokens held on the compromised system that would potentially be valid to access other resource servers.[¶](#section-4.9.2-1)

Preventing server breaches by hardening and monitoring server systems is considered a standard operational procedure and, therefore, out of the scope of this document. focuses on the impact of OAuth-related breaches and the replaying of captured access tokens.[¶](#section-4.9.2-2)

#### 4.9.3.

The following measures should be taken into account by implementers in order to cope with access token replay by malicious actors:[¶](#section-4.9.3-1)

- Sender-constrained access tokens, as described in, SHOULD be used to prevent the attacker from replaying the access tokens on other resource servers. If an attacker has only partial access to the compromised system, like a read-only access to web server logs, sender-constrained access tokens may also prevent replay on the compromised system.[¶](#section-4.9.3-2.1)
- Audience restriction as described in SHOULD be used to prevent replay of captured access tokens on other resource servers.[¶](#section-4.9.3-2.2)
- The resource server MUST treat access tokens like other sensitive secrets and not store or transfer them in plaintext.[¶](#section-4.9.3-2.3)

The first and second recommendations also apply to other scenarios where access tokens leak (see in ).[¶](#section-4.9.3-3)

### 4.10.

Access tokens can be stolen by an attacker in various ways, for example, via the attacks described in Sections,,,, and. Some of these attacks can be mitigated by specific security measures, as described in the respective sections. However, in some cases, these measures are not sufficient or are not implemented correctly. Authorization servers therefore SHOULD ensure that access tokens are sender-constrained and audience-restricted as described in the following. Architecture and performance reasons may prevent the use of these measures in some deployments.[¶](#section-4.10-1)

#### 4.10.1.

As the name suggests, sender-constrained access tokens scope the applicability of an access token to a certain sender. This sender is obliged to demonstrate knowledge of a certain secret as a prerequisite for the acceptance of that token at a resource server.[¶](#section-4.10.1-1)

A typical flow looks like this:[¶](#section-4.10.1-2)

1. The authorization server associates data with the access token that binds this particular token to a certain client. The binding can utilize the client's identity, but in most cases, the authorization server utilizes key material (or data derived from the key material) known to the client.[¶](#section-4.10.1-3.1)
2. This key material must be distributed somehow. Either the key material already exists before the authorization server creates the binding or the authorization server creates ephemeral keys. The way preexisting key material is distributed varies among the different approaches. For example, X.509 certificates can be used, in which case the distribution happens explicitly during the enrollment process. Or, the key material is created and distributed at the TLS layer, in which case it might automatically happen during the setup of a TLS connection.[¶](#section-4.10.1-3.2)
3. The resource server must implement the actual proof-of-possession check. This is typically done on the application level, often tied to specific material provided by the transport layer (e.g., TLS). The resource server must also ensure that a replay of the proof of possession is not possible.[¶](#section-4.10.1-3.3)

Two methods for sender-constrained access tokens using proof of possession have been defined by the OAuth working group and are in use in practice:[¶](#section-4.10.1-4)

- [["OAuth 2.0]] Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens" \[\]: The approach specified in this) document allows the use of mutual TLS for both client authentication and sender-constrained access tokens. For the purpose of sender-constrained access tokens, the client is identified towards the resource server by the fingerprint of its public key. During the processing of an access token request, the authorization server obtains the client's public key from the TLS stack and associates its fingerprint with the respective access tokens. The resource server in the same way obtains the public key from the TLS stack and compares its fingerprint with the fingerprint associated with the access token.[¶](#section-4.10.1-5.1)
- [["OAuth 2.0]] Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP)" \[\]: DPoP outlines an application-level mechanism for sender-constraining access and refresh tokens. It uses proof-of-possession based on a public/private key pair and application-level signing. DPoP can be used with public clients and, in the case of confidential clients, can be combined with any client authentication method.[¶](#section-4.10.1-5.2)

Note that the security of sender-constrained tokens is undermined when an attacker gets access to the token and the key material. This is, in particular, the case for corrupted client software and cross-site scripting attacks (when the client is running in the browser). If the key material is protected in a hardware or software security module or only indirectly accessible (like in a TLS stack), sender-constrained tokens at least protect against the use of the token when the client is offline, i.e., when the security module or interface is not available to the attacker. This applies to access tokens as well as to refresh tokens (see ).[¶](#section-4.10.1-6)

#### 4.10.2.

Audience restriction essentially restricts access tokens to a particular resource server. The authorization server associates the access token with the particular resource server, and the resource server is then supposed to verify the intended audience. If the access token fails the intended audience validation, the resource server refuses to serve the respective request.[¶](#section-4.10.2-1)

In general, audience restriction limits the impact of token leakage. In the case of a counterfeit resource server, it may (as described below) also prevent abuse of the phished access token at the legitimate resource server.[¶](#section-4.10.2-2)

The audience can be expressed using logical names or physical addresses (like URLs). To prevent phishing, it is necessary to use the actual URL the client will send requests to. In the phishing case, this URL will point to the counterfeit resource server. If the attacker tries to use the access token at the legitimate resource server (which has a different URL), the resource server will detect the mismatch (wrong audience) and refuse to serve the request.[¶](#section-4.10.2-3)

In deployments where the authorization server knows the URLs of all resource servers, the authorization server may just refuse to issue access tokens for unknown resource server URLs.[¶](#section-4.10.2-4)

For this to work, the client needs to tell the authorization server the intended resource server. The mechanism in \[\] can be used for this or the information can be encoded in the scope value ([Section 3.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-3.3) of \[\]).[¶](#section-4.10.2-5)

Instead of the URL, it is also possible to utilize the fingerprint of the resource server's X.509 certificate as the audience value. This variant would also allow detection of an attempt to spoof the legitimate resource server's URL by using a valid TLS certificate obtained from a different CA. It might also be considered a privacy benefit to hide the resource server URL from the authorization server.[¶](#section-4.10.2-6)

Audience restriction may seem easier to use since it does not require any cryptography on the client side. Still, since every access token is bound to a specific resource server, the client also needs to obtain a single resource server-specific access token when accessing several resource servers. (Resource indicators, as specified in \[\], can help to achieve this.) \[\] had the same property since different token-binding IDs must be associated with the access token. Using mutual TLS for OAuth 2.0 \[\], on the other hand, allows a client to use the access token at multiple resource servers.[¶](#section-4.10.2-7)

It should be noted that audience restrictions -- or, generally speaking, an indication by the client to the authorization server where it wants to use the access token -- have additional benefits beyond the scope of token leakage prevention. They allow the authorization server to create a different access token whose format and content are specifically minted for the respective server. This has huge functional and privacy advantages in deployments using structured access tokens.[¶](#section-4.10.2-8)

#### 4.10.3.

An authorization server could provide the client with additional information about the locations where it is safe to use its access tokens. This approach, and why it is not recommended, is discussed in the following.[¶](#section-4.10.3-1)

In the simplest form, this would require the authorization server to publish a list of its known resource servers, illustrated in the following example using a non-standard Authorization Server Metadata parameter `resource_servers`:[¶](#section-4.10.3-2)

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "issuer":"https://server.somesite.example",
  "authorization_endpoint":
    "https://server.somesite.example/authorize",
  "resource_servers":[
    "email.somesite.example",
    "storage.somesite.example",
    "video.somesite.example"
  ]
  ...
}
```
[¶](#section-4.10.3-3)

The authorization server could also return the URL(s) an access token is good for in the token response, illustrated by the example and non-standard return parameter `access_token_resource_server`:[¶](#section-4.10.3-4)

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
  "access_token_resource_server":
    "https://hostedresource.somesite.example/path1",
...
}
```
[¶](#section-4.10.3-5)

This mitigation strategy would rely on the client to enforce the security policy and to only send access tokens to legitimate destinations. Results of OAuth-related security research (see, for example, \[\] and \[\]) indicate a large portion of client implementations do not or fail to properly implement security controls, like `state` checks. So, relying on clients to prevent access token phishing is likely to fail as well. Moreover, given the ratio of clients to authorization and resource servers, it is considered the more viable approach to move as much as possible security-related logic to those servers. Clearly, the client has to contribute to the overall security. However, there are alternative countermeasures, as described in Sections and, that provide a better balance between the involved parties.[¶](#section-4.10.3-6)

### 4.11.

The following attacks can occur when an authorization server or client has an open redirector. Such endpoints are sometimes implemented, for example, to show a message before a user is then redirected to an external website, or to redirect users back to a URL they were intending to visit before being interrupted, e.g., by a login prompt.[¶](#section-4.11-1)

#### 4.11.1.

Clients MUST NOT expose open redirectors. Attackers may use open redirectors to produce URLs pointing to the client and utilize them to exfiltrate authorization codes and access tokens, as described in. Another abuse case is to produce URLs that appear to point to the client. This might trick users into trusting the URL and following it in their browser. This can be abused for phishing.[¶](#section-4.11.1-1)

In order to prevent open redirection, clients should only redirect if the target URLs are allowed or if the origin and integrity of a request can be authenticated. Countermeasures against open redirection are described by OWASP \[\].[¶](#section-4.11.1-2)

#### 4.11.2.

Just as with clients, attackers could try to utilize a user's trust in the authorization server (and its URL in particular) for performing phishing attacks. OAuth authorization servers regularly redirect users to other websites (the clients), but they must do so safely.[¶](#section-4.11.2-1)

[Section 4.1.2.1](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1) of \[\] already prevents open redirects by stating that the authorization server MUST NOT automatically redirect the user agent in case of an invalid combination of `client_id` and `redirect_uri`.[¶](#section-4.11.2-2)

However, an attacker could also utilize a correctly registered redirection URI to perform phishing attacks. The attacker could, for example, register a client via dynamic client registration \[\] and execute one of the following attacks:[¶](#section-4.11.2-3)

1. Intentionally send an erroneous authorization request, e.g., by using an invalid scope value, thus instructing the authorization server to redirect the user agent to its phishing site.[¶](#section-4.11.2-4.1)
2. Intentionally send a valid authorization request with `client_id` and `redirect_uri` controlled by the attacker. After the user authenticates, the authorization server prompts the user to provide consent to the request. If the user notices an issue with the request and declines the request, the authorization server still redirects the user agent to the phishing site. In this case, the user agent will be redirected to the phishing site regardless of the action taken by the user.[¶](#section-4.11.2-4.2)
3. Intentionally send a valid silent authentication request (`prompt=none`) with `client_id` and `redirect_uri` controlled by the attacker. In this case, the authorization server will automatically redirect the user agent to the phishing site.[¶](#section-4.11.2-4.3)

The authorization server MUST take precautions to prevent these threats. The authorization server MUST always authenticate the user first and, with the exception of the silent authentication use case, prompt the user for credentials when needed, before redirecting the user. Based on its risk assessment, the authorization server needs to decide whether or not it can trust the redirection URI. It could take into account URI analytics done internally or through some external service to evaluate the credibility and trustworthiness of content behind the URI, and the source of the redirection URI and other client data.[¶](#section-4.11.2-5)

The authorization server SHOULD only automatically redirect the user agent if it trusts the redirection URI. If the URI is not trusted, the authorization server MAY inform the user and rely on the user to make the correct decision.[¶](#section-4.11.2-6)

### 4.12.

At the authorization endpoint, a typical protocol flow is that the authorization server prompts the user to enter their credentials in a form that is then submitted (using the HTTP POST method) back to the authorization server. The authorization server checks the credentials and, if successful, redirects the user agent to the client's redirection endpoint.[¶](#section-4.12-1)

In \[\], the HTTP status code 302 (Found) is used for this purpose, but "any other method available via the user-agent to accomplish this redirection is allowed". When the status code 307 is used for redirection instead, the user agent will send the user's credentials via HTTP POST to the client.[¶](#section-4.12-2)

This discloses the sensitive credentials to the client. If the client is malicious, it can use the credentials to impersonate the user at the authorization server.[¶](#section-4.12-3)

The behavior might be unexpected for developers but is defined in [Section 15.4.8](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.4.8) of \[\]. This status code (307) does not require the user agent to rewrite the POST request to a GET request and thereby drop the form data in the POST request body.[¶](#section-4.12-4)

In the HTTP standard \[\], only the status code 303 unambiguously enforces rewriting the HTTP POST request to an HTTP GET request. For all other status codes, including the popular 302, user agents can opt not to rewrite POST to GET requests, thereby causing the user's credentials to be revealed to the client. (In practice, however, most user agents will only show this behavior for 307 redirects.) [¶](#section-4.12-5)

Authorization servers that redirect a request that potentially contains the user's credentials therefore MUST NOT use the HTTP 307 status code for redirection. If an HTTP redirection (and not, for example, JavaScript) is used for such a request, the authorization server SHOULD use HTTP status code 303 (See Other).[¶](#section-4.12-6)

### 4.13.

A common deployment architecture for HTTP applications is to hide the application server behind a reverse proxy that terminates the TLS connection and dispatches the incoming requests to the respective application server nodes.[¶](#section-4.13-1)

This section highlights some attack angles of this deployment architecture with relevance to OAuth and gives recommendations for security controls.[¶](#section-4.13-2)

In some situations, the reverse proxy needs to pass security-related data to the upstream application servers for further processing. Examples include the IP address of the request originator, token-binding IDs, and authenticated TLS client certificates. This data is usually passed in HTTP headers added to the upstream request. While the headers are often custom, application-specific headers, standardized header fields for client certificates and client certificate chains are defined in \[\].[¶](#section-4.13-3)

If the reverse proxy passes through any header sent from the outside, an attacker could try to directly send the faked header values through the proxy to the application server in order to circumvent security controls that way. For example, it is standard practice of reverse proxies to accept `X-Forwarded-For` headers and just add the origin of the inbound request (making it a list). Depending on the logic performed in the application server, the attacker could simply add an allowed IP address to the header and render the protection useless.[¶](#section-4.13-4)

A reverse proxy MUST therefore sanitize any inbound requests to ensure the authenticity and integrity of all header values relevant for the security of the application servers.[¶](#section-4.13-5)

If an attacker were able to get access to the internal network between the proxy and application server, the attacker could also try to circumvent security controls in place. Therefore, it is essential to ensure the authenticity of the communicating entities. Furthermore, the communication link between the reverse proxy and application server MUST be protected against eavesdropping, injection, and replay of messages.[¶](#section-4.13-6)

### 4.14.

Refresh tokens are a convenient and user-friendly way to obtain new access tokens. They also add to the security of OAuth, since they allow the authorization server to issue access tokens with a short lifetime and reduced scope, thus reducing the potential impact of access token leakage.[¶](#section-4.14-1)

### 4.15.

Resource servers may make access control decisions based on the identity of a resource owner for which an access token was issued, or based on the identity of a client in the client credentials grant. For example, \[\] (JSON Web Token (JWT) [[Profile]] for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens) describes a data structure for access tokens containing a `sub` claim defined as follows:[¶](#section-4.15-1)

> In cases of access tokens obtained through grants where a resource owner is involved, such as the authorization code grant, the value of "sub" SHOULD correspond to the subject identifier of the resource owner. In cases of access tokens obtained through grants where no resource owner is involved, such as the client credentials grant, the value of "sub" SHOULD correspond to an identifier the authorization server uses to indicate the client application.[¶](#section-4.15-2.1)

If both options are possible, a resource server may mistake a client's identity for the identity of a resource owner. For example, if a client is able to choose its own `client_id` during registration with the authorization server, a malicious client may set it to a value identifying a resource owner (e.g., a `sub` value if [[OpenID Connect]] is used). If the resource server cannot properly distinguish between access tokens obtained with involvement of the resource owner and those without, the client may accidentally be able to access resources belonging to the resource owner.[¶](#section-4.15-3)

This attack potentially affects not only implementations using \[\], but also similar, bespoke solutions.[¶](#section-4.15-4)

#### 4.15.1.

Authorization servers SHOULD NOT allow clients to influence their `client_id` or any other claim that could cause confusion with a genuine resource owner if a common namespace for client IDs and user identifiers exists, such as in the `sub` claim example from \[\] shown in above. Where this cannot be avoided, authorization servers MUST provide other means for the resource server to distinguish between the two types of access tokens.[¶](#section-4.15.1-1)

### 4.16.

As described in [Section 4.4.1.9](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.9) of \[\], the authorization request is susceptible to clickjacking attacks, also called user interface redressing. In such an attack, an attacker embeds the authorization endpoint user interface in an innocuous context. A user believing to interact with that context, for example, by clicking on buttons, inadvertently interacts with the authorization endpoint user interface instead. The opposite can be achieved as well: A user believing to interact with the authorization endpoint might inadvertently type a password into an attacker-provided input field overlaid over the original user interface. Clickjacking attacks can be designed such that users can hardly notice the attack, for example, using almost invisible iframes overlaid on top of other elements.[¶](#section-4.16-1)

An attacker can use this vector to obtain the user's authentication credentials, change the scope of access granted to the client, and potentially access the user's resources.[¶](#section-4.16-2)

Authorization servers MUST prevent clickjacking attacks. Multiple countermeasures are described in \[\], including the use of the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header field and frame-busting JavaScript. In addition to those, authorization servers SHOULD also use Content Security Policy (CSP) level 2 \[\] or greater.[¶](#section-4.16-3)

To be effective, CSP must be used on the authorization endpoint and, if applicable, other endpoints used to authenticate the user and authorize the client (e.g., the device authorization endpoint, login pages, error pages, etc.). This prevents framing by unauthorized origins in user agents that support CSP. The client MAY permit being framed by some other origin than the one used in its redirection endpoint. For this reason, authorization servers SHOULD allow administrators to configure allowed origins for particular clients and/or for clients to register these dynamically.[¶](#section-4.16-4)

Using CSP allows authorization servers to specify multiple origins in a single response header field and to constrain these using flexible patterns (see \[\] for details). Level 2 of CSP provides a robust mechanism for protecting against clickjacking by using policies that restrict the origin of frames (by using `frame-ancestors`) together with those that restrict the sources of scripts allowed to execute on an HTML page (by using `script-src`). A non-normative example of such a policy is shown in the following listing:[¶](#section-4.16-5)

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://ext.example.org:8000
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://ext.example.org:8000
...
```
[¶](#section-4.16-6)

Because some user agents do not support \[\], this technique SHOULD be combined with others, including those described in \[\], unless such legacy user agents are explicitly unsupported by the authorization server. Even in such cases, additional countermeasures SHOULD still be employed.[¶](#section-4.16-7)

### 4.17.

If the authorization response is sent with in-browser communication techniques like postMessage \[\] instead of HTTP redirects, messages may inadvertently be sent to malicious origins or injected from malicious origins.[¶](#section-4.17-1)

#### 4.17.1.

The following non-normative pseudocode examples of attacks using in-browser communication are described in \[\].[¶](#section-4.17.1-1)

##### 4.17.1.1.

When sending the authorization response or token response via postMessage, the authorization server sends the response to the wildcard origin "\*" instead of the client's origin. When the window to which the response is sent is controlled by an attacker, the attacker can read the response.[¶](#section-4.17.1.1-1)

```javascript
window.opener.postMessage(
  {
    code: "ABC",
    state: "123"
  },
  "*" // any website in the opener window can receive the message
)
```
[¶](#section-4.17.1.1-2)

##### 4.17.1.2.

When sending the authorization response or token response via postMessage, the authorization server may not check the receiver origin against the redirection URI and instead, for example, may send the response to an origin provided by an attacker. This is analogous to the attack described in.[¶](#section-4.17.1.2-1)

```javascript
window.opener.postMessage(
  {
    code: "ABC",
    state: "123"
  },
  "https://attacker.example" // attacker-provided value
)
```
[¶](#section-4.17.1.2-2)

##### 4.17.1.3.

A client that expects the authorization response or token response via postMessage may not validate the sender origin of the message. This may allow an attacker to inject an authorization response or token response into the client.[¶](#section-4.17.1.3-1)

In the case of a maliciously injected authorization response, the attack is a variant of the CSRF attacks described in. The countermeasures described in apply to this attack as well.[¶](#section-4.17.1.3-2)

In the case of a maliciously injected token response, sender-constrained access tokens as described in may prevent the attack under some circumstances, but additional countermeasures as described in are generally required.[¶](#section-4.17.1.3-3)

#### 4.17.2.

When comparing client receiver origins against pre-registered origins, authorization servers MUST utilize exact string matching as described in. Authorization servers MUST send postMessages to trusted client receiver origins, as shown in the following, non-normative example:[¶](#section-4.17.2-1)

```javascript
window.opener.postMessage(
  {
    code: "ABC",
    state: "123"
  },
  "https://client.example" // use explicit client origin
)
```
[¶](#section-4.17.2-2)

Wildcard origins like "\*" in postMessage MUST NOT be used, as attackers can use them to leak a victim's in-browser message to malicious origins. Both measures contribute to the prevention of leakage of authorization codes and access tokens (see ).[¶](#section-4.17.2-3)

Clients MUST prevent injection of in-browser messages on the client receiver endpoint. Clients MUST utilize exact string matching to compare the initiator origin of an in-browser message with the authorization server origin, as shown in the following, non-normative example:[¶](#section-4.17.2-4)

```javascript
window.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
  // validate exact authorization server origin
  if (e.origin === "https://honest.as.example") {
    // process e.data.code and e.data.state
  }
})
```
[¶](#section-4.17.2-5)

Since in-browser communication flows only apply a different communication technique (i.e., postMessage instead of HTTP redirect), all measures protecting the authorization response listed in MUST be applied equally.[¶](#section-4.17.2-6)
